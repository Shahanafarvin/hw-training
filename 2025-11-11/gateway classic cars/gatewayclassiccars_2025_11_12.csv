The Ford Anglia began life as a simple British economy car. This one, however, has crossed the Atlantic and gone completely rogue. Beneath its compact shell lives a masterpiece of American engineering - a Boss 514 Ford Hemi by Jon Kaase - the kind of engine that makes grown gearheads stop mid-sentence. Powertrain Deep Dive - Boss 514 Jon Kaase Ford Hemi At the heart of this Anglia sits a 514 cubic-inch Jon Kaase-built Ford Hemi, a legendary big-block known for its brute torque and precision craftsmanship. Kaase, a championship-winning Pro Stock engine designer, built these hemis for those who demand more than power - they demand excellence. With aluminum Jon Kaase Hemi heads, hemispherical combustion chambers, and a 460-based stroker bottom end, this engine breathes effortlessly and revs with frightening smoothness. Estimated output: 650+ horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, depending on tune. Cooling is handled by a custom aluminum system, engineered to keep big-block temperatures in check within the compact Anglia body. The 15-gallon fuel cell feeds this beast, and the idle alone tells you it's something special - deep, steady, and pure Kaase thunder. Transmission & Driveline Power is delivered through a TCI C6 3-speed automatic transmission with a TCI performance shifter, built to handle every ounce of torque. Out back, a Strange Engineering rear end and Detroit Locker posi unit ensure both tires stay hooked when the throttle drops. A 3.25 rear gear provides a precision blend of acceleration and highway composure. Chassis & Suspension Underneath, this Anglia rides on an Art Morrison chassis, renowned for precision geometry and strength. A 4-point roll bar adds rigidity and safety, while spindle-mount front wheels and Wilwood disc brakes bring serious stopping power to match the performance. The 15-gallon fuel cell is mounted low for ideal weight balance and handling. Design & Presentation Finished in a brilliant Blue, this Anglia has presence in every sense of the word - squat stance, fat rear tires, and an aura that radiates controlled aggression. Inside, the Black vinyl interior is clean and functional, built for the driver, not for show trophies. Every switch and gauge serves a purpose.

The result is power refined by precision, a street rod that blends old-school attitude with race-level hardware. With only 571 miles since completion, it remains as fresh as it is ferocious.

Power comes from a 454 cubic-inch big-block V8 breathing through Hooker Competition headers and exhaling through a deep dual-exhaust system. According to the build specifications, the engine is rated at roughly 365 horsepower, the factory figure for Chevrolet's 1971 LS5. Torque output varied by tune-factory literature listed approximately 465 lb-ft-and this setup feels every bit that strong. Cooling is handled by a high-capacity aluminum radiator, giving the car the reliability and temperature control expected from a true driver's build. The engine bay is tidy and purposeful-no flash, just craftsmanship and care. Inside, the black bucket seats with SS embroidery, center console, and factory-style gauges keep the authentic muscle-car look intact. Power steering and power brakes make it easy to enjoy while preserving the feel that made Chevelles legends. The trim tag (ST 71-13637) confirms this car began life as a V8 Sport Coupe built in Baltimore, later restored and finished as a well-executed SS tribute. Solid, clean, and built to be driven-it's a Chevelle that rewards seat time as much as admiration. With its 454 big block, Hooker headers, and aluminum radiator, this Chevelle delivers the balance of strength, sound, and dependability that made the name Chevelle SS a benchmark of American power.

What's more hard core, true blue, Americana, than a big block Chevelle? First, lets address the elephant in the room. Is this a real ""SS"" Chevelle or not. Well, it is a 13637 which allegedly the ""SS"" cars were. It does have the square steering shaft used only for the big block cars. And, it does have the 12-bolt rear diff. When you present the evidence, could it be a real Super Sport? It could be. However, without the factory build sheet and/or an original window stick there's just no way to tell. Now, you can easily take a peek at the front engine pad and see the matching vin number stamped in full display. The BB 402 is smooth, quiet, and powerful. The turbo 400 trans shifts crisp and sharp. You have to see this Chevelle in the light to do it justice. The (62) Burnt Orange Poly is gorgeous and the black interior (706) with the correct Magnesium Rally wheels create a truly beautiful combination. Is this Chevelle more of an oddity or a rarity? With its colorful combo, factory NM big block, and factory A/C, that's a question for you to answer. Chances are you won't find another one like it anywhere. If you are on the hunt for a solid, well cared for, early 70s Chevelle then look no further. First Name Please provide a first name. Last Name Please provide a last name.

The Baja Bug was born from off-road rebellion - a grassroots movement that turned humble Beetles into desert legends. Simple, light, and tough, they became symbols of freedom, from California dunes to Mexican backroads. This 1974 Volkswagen Baja Bug carries that adventurous spirit into the modern day, freshly equipped with thoughtful upgrades that make it as capable as it is charismatic. Exterior & Chassis Built for fun and durability, this Bug features a double-tube off-road front bumper and matching rear bumper with skid plate, a 4-point roll bar, custom rock rails, and front tow hooks - all powder-coated in striking Gulf Oil Orange, along with the five original wheels. A roof rack with metal framing and wood-slat floor adds vintage charm and practical storage. The stance comes courtesy of adjustable coil-over shocks and Toyo Open Country AT III all-terrain tires (front P225/75R15, rear 30x9.50R15LT), ready for any terrain. Interior & Comfort Inside, a pair of EMPI racing high-back tweed seats with RaceQuip 4-point harnesses hold you firmly in place. The cabin has been lined with Design Engineering Boom Mat for heat and sound insulation - applied under the carpet, across the rear firewall, and throughout the cabin for a more refined driving experience. VDO gauges monitor oil temperature and pressure, while LASFIT LED headlights provide modern visibility for night runs. Powertrain & Mechanics Power comes from a 1600cc air-cooled 4-cylinder, paired with a 4-speed manual transmission - the classic VW setup known for reliability and mechanical honesty. The engine benefits from a Pertronix 1847An electronic ignition system and Pertronix coil, replacing the original points for cleaner, more efficient firing. The exhaust system features ceramic-coated J-pipes and muffler (8-piece system) for improved flow and longevity. Utility & Accessories Practicality meets preparedness: a battery trickle-charge connector sits conveniently behind the passenger seat, so charging is simple and accessible. Included is an orange spare-parts bag filled with essentials like belts, ignition components, spark plugs, and a small air compressor. The sale also includes a tow bar for RV or truck towing, and the original VW jack (stored in its black bag). Body & Details Fiberglass Baja fenders front and rear, steel firewall reinforcement, replica 1961-1967 taillights, and rear tow loops complete the rugged aesthetic.

Chevrolet,Impala,1965,0000166375J305785,114000,8517,Tremec TKO Manual,505 V8,Blue,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars Houston Showroom is proud to present this 1965 Chevrolet Impala SS restomod. This fully re-engineered 1965 Impala SS blends classic style with modern performance. At the heart is a fresh CHEVY BBC 496ci (505hp) Stage 6.0 engine built on a Dart Big M block - an aftermarket block engineered for maximum durability and strength. Dart's Big M blocks feature precision machining, superior strength, and priority main oiling to ensure reliability and power. Inside the block, we've installed Wiseco forged pistons. Unlike cast pistons, Wiseco's high-strength forged aluminum pistons are lighter and stronger, allowing higher compression and revving without failure. In practice this means the Impala's engine can handle serious horsepower and abuse while remaining rock-solid. The fuel system is modernized with an Edelbrock Pro-Flo electronic fuel injection kit, replacing the old carburetor. EFI ensures each cylinder gets the precise fuel metering it needs under all conditions, delivering instant throttle response and smoother power delivery. It provides crisp, solid shifts and a reliable connection between the big-block's power and the rear wheels. Complementing this is a Ram precision-machined billet steel flywheel. The heavy-duty Ram flywheel adds useful inertia for smooth launch and low-speed drivability. Paired with a high-performance twin-disc clutch kit from McLeod Racing, this drivetrain launches the Impala with confidence. The McLeod twin-clutch design doubles the friction surface area, allowing enormous grip without the extra weight of a single huge clutch. As Motor Trend notes, a McLeod twin-disc clutch delivers ""mega grip without the extra weight"" - it's about 10 pounds lighter than stock, yet it grips more firmly and requires less pedal effort. In short, this engine-and-transmission package lets you ""get on it"" with a light, positive clutch feel while the forged internals and billet components handle the abuse. The chassis of this Impala has been completely reworked for modern handling. Up front and out back the suspension uses fully adjustable coil-over shock-and-spring assemblies. Unlike the old leaf springs and shocks, coil overs allow precise control of ride height and damping, so the car's body is flat and planted in corners. Coil-over systems are prized in performance builds because they are ""fully tunable"" for both spring preload and shock valving, delivering ""better geometry"" and a firmer, more controlled ride than stock setups. With the adjustable springs, you can lower the car for a lower center of gravity and stiffen it for aggressive street driving, yet still retain comfort on the highway. The suspension arms themselves have been upgraded to heavy-duty tubular control arms. These modern arms are made from high-strength steel tubing, making them lighter and stronger than the original stamped-steel A-arms. The tubular design also corrects the outdated geometry of the stock setup, allowing more negative camber and optimal caster angles. In fact, QA1 - a leading suspension manufacturer - explains that tubular control arms reduce unsprung weight and allow modern alignment settings (like extra negative camber gain) that vastly improve handling. In practice this means better turn-in grip and stability under load. Inside, the Impala balances classic character with driver comfort. The bucket seats and door panels are trimmed in durable black cloth, accented by supple black leather in key areas for a touch of luxury. This combination was chosen for both its classic muscle-car appearance and its comfort. Modern conveniences abound: factory-style air conditioning keeps the cabin cool in summer, while a retro-styled AM/FM radio and premium sound system lets you enjoy music in cruise mode. Power steering, power brakes, and power door locks make everyday driving easy and comfortable. Even the tilt-adjustable steering wheel lets drivers of any size find the ideal position. Custom alloy wheels with modern wide radial tires add a distinctive look and grip, and a comfortable front bench and rear seat ensure the Impala is just as functional as it is powerful. In short, the interior feels like a well-equipped classic: vintage charm with all the modern usability features you expect in a high-end restomod. The end result is an Impala SS that drives like a modern performance sedan but sounds and feels like old-school muscle. Throttle input is met with instant response from the EFI'd 505ci V8, and the exhaust bellow combines classic big-block roar with seamless idle and midrange due to modern tuning. The hydraulic McLeod twin-disc clutch, paired with the balanced Ram flywheel, allows the engine to rev freely off the stop but also gives smooth engagement when launching - you can feel the full torque of the motor without any hesitation or chattering. Shifts through the robust Tremec five-speed are positive and precise, thanks to a short-throw shifter and modern linkage. What truly sets this Impala apart is how the upgraded engine and suspension work together. The stiffened chassis and coil-overs mean that when you floor it or dive into a corner, the body remains flat and predictable. The tires bite the pavement, and the steering is sharp and direct - far removed from the vague feel of the original. Combined with those massive Wilwood brakes, the car begs to be driven hard. Experienced drivers will appreciate that this classic no longer softly wallows through curves; instead it rewards aggressive inputs with true muscle-car thrills. Even at highway speeds, the car is stable and controlled, not only thanks to the suspension but also the 50-year newer tires and modern alignment. In summary, this 1965 Impala SS resto-mod blends raw power with refinement. Each upgrade was chosen to make the car as drivable and reliable as possible. The result is a true high-performance classic: one that you can hop in for a leisurely Sunday cruise or take on a winding back road and wring out its legs. It evokes the visceral excitement of vintage muscle - the rumble, the quick throttle response - but it behaves like a modern sports car. It's a thrilling, instant classic that delivers modern handling, braking, and comfort without losing any of that legendary 1960s attitude. With powerful polished V8 under the hood, precise suspension, and thoughtful amenities inside, this Impala SS is ready to excite any enthusiast who loves a blend of nostalgia and capability.

Chevrolet,Chevelle,1969,0000136379K454665,111000,991,M20 Muncie 4 speed Manual,L78  V8,Orange,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars Houston Showroom is proud to present this 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle 396SS. The 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 stands as a pinnacle of the classic American muscle car era. Few cars stood out from the rest like the 1969 L78 SS396 Chevelle, and enthusiasts regard the Chevelle as one of the most iconic muscle cars ever. For 1969 the Chevelle's long-hood, short-deck styling (introduced in 1968) continued, and Chevrolet reintroduced the highest-output 396 cubic-inch engine in its lineup. The SS396 hardtop (and convertible) could be ordered with the legendary L78 option - a 375-horsepower version of the Turbo-Jet 396 - which cemented the Chevelle's reputation for bold styling paired with truly high-end performance. The L78 option was famously elusive and rare. It was never listed in the standard sales brochures, requiring a special dealer order (RPO L78). he L78 option was expensive for its day ($252.80 in 1969) and delivered an uncompromising 375 horsepower (with 415lb-ft torque at 3, 600rpm)Only 9, 486 Chevelles were built from the factory with the L78 in 1969. Today the L78 396 is highly prized by collectors for its rarity and historical significance - a verified L78 engine code (as recorded on the L78 registry) is a potent mark of authenticity and investment value. Mechanically, the L78 396 was a thoroughly race-ready big-block. It was the only factory SS396 engine with four-bolt main bearing caps, and it used a nitrided forged-steel crankshaft for extreme durability. Chevrolet equipped the L78 with solid lifters, 11.5:1 compression pistons, and aggressive cam profiles. The iron cylinder heads were the high-performance ""square-port"" design with massive 2.19-inch intake valves. Breathing was handled by a cast-aluminum high-rise intake manifold (often called a Winters ""snowflake"" manifold) feeding a 4150-series Holley vacuum-secondary four-barrel carburetor rated at 780cfm. In stock form this combination yielded the factory 375hp at 5, 600rpm and 415lb-ft at 3, 600rpm.In short, the L78's forged internals, robust valvetrain, and generous airflow made it one of Chevrolet's most potent production engines of the era. This specific Chevelle SS396 is finished in its original Orange exterior paint over a carefully redone black interior. The L78 engine has been rebuilt by Competition Auto Machine (Spring, Texas) to factory specifications, with a modern roller cam installed for reliability while preserving the correct power curve. The drivetrain uses the correct Muncie M20 wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission and a heavy-duty 12-bolt rear end. Notably, the rear end now wears 3.73:1 gears (upgraded from the original 4.11:1) for a more usable cruising ratio. Restoration work was scrupulous: the bare frame was media-blasted and powder-coated, and all suspension and steering components were rebuilt to original F41 SS396 specification. The car is equipped with period-correct amenities (and some sympathetic upgrades): Vintage Air air conditioning (styled like factory A/C), an AM/FM radio, power steering and original-style power-assisted front disc brakes (the rear discs also updated for safety), plus modern radial tires and lap seatbelts. Overall, the fit and finish reflect a high-quality restoration that balances authenticity with drivability and comfort. Owning this 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 L78 is far more than acquiring a restored classic; it is securing a piece of muscle car history that represents the peak of Chevrolet's engineering in the golden era. With its verified L78 registration, restoration, and painstakingly accurate mechanical rebuild, this Chevelle stands among the most desirable examples available today. The combination of rarity, performance pedigree, and thorough restoration ensures that it is not only a car to be enjoyed on the road but also one that will continue to appreciate in value as demand for authentic investment-grade muscle cars grows. For the discerning collector, this Chevelle is the kind of opportunity that does not come around often-equal parts showpiece, performer, and blue-chip investment.

The first Packard station wagon appeared in the fledgling ""Six"" model line in 1939 and the company sold 500 examples of the station wagon that first year. That popularity of the ""Woody"" station wagon prompted them to enlist the services of the long-established Hercules Body Company of Evansville, Indiana, for its 1940 wagons in both the 110 and 120 lineups. (This example being Body# 298). The Hercules Company was a very established company by this point in history; their initial trade having been as carriage builders just after the turn of the century. The 1940 wood-bodied Packard's were made of ash frames with birch panels. (At an additional cost, Mahogany panels could be ordered). For 1940, Packard supplied 358 Hercules bodies for the combined 110 and 120 model lines. The ""110"" models, which had a 122-inch wheelbase with a six-cylinder engine, while the ""120"" models had a 127-inch wheelbase and an eight-cylinder engine. The body designs were identical with the extra length on the One-Twenty being utilized by the larger engine and the firewall. This 1940 Packard 110 example rests on a 122-inch wheelbase chassis (Chassis #13832178) and is powered by a 245 cubic-inch flathead six-cylinder engine (Engine# C-19230B). This car was delivered in May of 1940 by the Boston Packard dealer and by the mid-1970s had been moved into the care of a California resident, where it was treated to a complete makeover by that owner. Upon completion, it was placed in a specially built alcove in the owner's living room! It appeared on the cover of Packard's International magazine in 1989, which was one of its very few public showings, and then later passed to another collector who had it kept in a climate-controlled storage area and treated to another extensive restoration to original specifications by Custom Auto Service in 2006-2007 and is also an esteemed Packard International Circle of Champions vehicle. Less than a dozen Packard 110 Station Wagons are known to be in existence & only one or two in the completely collectible condition of this car. In 2007 it was brought to the Gooding & Company auction held in Pebble Beach, Ca. where it was estimated to sell for $200, 000 - $260, 000. While those estimates were not achieved, the lot was still sold in 2007 for a whopping $181, 500! This is a very rare opportunity to acquire an investment grade, museum quality 1940 Packard 110 Woody Wagon that only comes along every couple decades, so don't miss out on this chance to join the ultra-exclusive collector club.

With its chopped stance, widened steel body, and mirror-black finish, this car doesn't just turn heads - it stops time. Starting life with the complete frame and drivetrain of a 2005 Chevrolet SSR, the foundation was sandblasted, clear-coated, and buffed to mirror before the all-steel 1940 Ford body was grafted on. The team at Bowden Customs of Riverton, Illinois executed a jaw-dropping transformation: six inches added down the centerline for a broader, more aggressive profile, and a six-inch roof chop that gives the car its sinister silhouette. The body and paint alone represent over 1, 000 labor hours of hand-built artistry. Inside, the craftsmanship continues. The custom SSR-based interior, finished by Twin City Upholstery of Bloomington, Illinois, wraps you in deep red leather with black accents and modern comfort amenities - 10-way power heated seats, power windows and locks, cruise control, and a Kenwood premium sound system. The design bridges classic hot-rod flair with contemporary refinement. Performance comes from a 390-horsepower LS2 V8 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, delivering both muscle and smooth drivability. Air-ride suspension allows you to adjust ride height at will, combining stance and comfort seamlessly. With just 6, 093 miles since the build, this masterpiece is as fresh as it is ferocious. Modern safety enhancements include anti-lock brakes, traction control, dual airbags, and even a backup camera, making this showpiece as practical as it is stunning. Aggressive. Sculpted. Timeless. This 1940 Ford Coupe Restomod represents the golden age of design reimagined for the modern era - a rolling work of art that commands presence from every angle. This 1940 Ford Coupe Restomod can be seen at the St. Louis Showroom located at 1237 Central Park Drive, O'Fallon IL 62269.

""Hey little Cobra don't you know you're gonna shut 'em down."" (The Rip Chords 1963). In the early 1960s when Carroll Shelby took a British AC Ace and shoved an American V8 under the hood not only did it put Ferrari on notice, it took the Automotive world by storm. On the track and on the street, nothing could touch a Shelby Cobra. Original production Cobra's are very hard to come by and can run deep into the the six figures or even higher. Of the builders creating Cobra replica's today, Superformance is the only one licensed by Shelby automotive - www.superformance.com/factory-models/mkiii . Since 1996, Superformance has produced only a very limited number of Cobra's and maintain their reputation for quality and being most like the original production models. This '65 SC MKIII has been in the possession of it's current owner since 2001. Before bringing the car to Gateway, the RDI 351w powerplant was freshened up and now produces just shy of 500hp. That may not be in the 600-700hp range of some of today's supercars, but this Cobra tips the scales at only 2500lbs making it scary fast. You won't find frivolous man card revoking creature comforts like Nav, a back up camera, traction control, or parking assist here. You get a steering wheel, a gear shifter for your Tremec 5-speed, and a seat with side pipes spitting fire in your ear drums telling you to be a man! New Cooper Cobra tires were recently installed and an alignment performed making this beast road ready. Included with the sale are the top, side curtains, tonneau cover and a full car cover.

The use of billet aluminum door pulls and trim pieces adds sophistication as well. Drivers will enjoy the polished chrome tilt steering column, which adds a level of comfort adjustment in addition to its good looks.

Both occupants will enjoy the power windows, along with the tunes provided by the AM/FM/CD head unit in the overhead console, and the year 'round comfort that the HVAC system provides.

Chevrolet,150,1957,0000000C57S219864,80000,134,Manual,V8,Black and White,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars of St. Louis is proud to digitally present this 1957 Chevrolet 150 Black Widow Tribute. The Black Widow is one of the most fascinating legends in Chevrolet's racing history. In June of 1957, the Automobile Manufacturers Association banned automakers from officially participating in racing. Publicly, GM and others complied - but behind the scenes, Chevrolet kept the spirit alive. Former Hudson race engineer Vince Piggins set up operations under SEDCO (Southern Engineering and Development Co.) at Nalley Chevrolet in Atlanta, turning humble Chevy 150 sedans into NASCAR terrors. Known as ""Black Widows, "" these lightweight, stripped-down cars became dominant on the track, and to this day remain a point of pride and heated debate among Chevrolet enthusiasts. This tribute to that history takes the Black Widow concept into the modern era. Under the hood sits a supercharged 6.2L LSA V8 - the same powerplant found in the Camaro ZL1 and Cadillac CTS-V - delivering modern muscle far beyond anything possible in 1957. Paired with a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission, this '57 combines raw horsepower with an engaging, driver-focused experience. Supporting the power are modern conveniences that make this car as usable as it is thrilling: Power steering for smooth maneuverability Power brakes for confident stopping AM/FM radio for cruising comfort Finished in the distinctive Black Widow tribute livery, this Chevrolet 150 captures the look of a NASCAR legend while bringing modern engineering to the mix. It's both a respectful nod to history and a bold reimagining of what the Black Widow could be today.

Ford,Mustang,1969,0000009T02H186888,79000,45030,C6 3 Speed Automatic,351 CID V8,Candy Apple Red,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars of Dallas is proud to present this exceptionally rare 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 T5, finished in Candy Apple Red over a black cloth interior. More than just a classic pony car, this is a documented example of a unique German-delivery T5 model, one of the most fascinating variations in Ford Mustang history. This vehicle was built at the Metuchen, New Jersey plant and exported to West Germany as part of Ford's overseas delivery program during a time when the Mustang name could not be used due to copyright conflicts. In the 1960s, a West German manufacturer held the trademark rights to the name ""Mustang, "" which meant Ford was unable to use the nameplate for vehicles sold in that country. Rather than purchase the rights, Ford chose to identify the export models using the internal design code: T5. As a result, cars like this one received modified badging and omitted all references to the Mustang name while retaining the same mechanical specifications, trim levels, and performance capabilities. These cars were sold through West German Ford dealerships or to American servicemen stationed in Europe via military PX programs. This particular T5 was originally purchased on May 7, 1969, by U.S. Army Captain Thomas Reichert from the American PX outside of Wurzburg, Germany. Captain Reichert chose the T5 Mach 1 over a Cyclone GT based on its design and took delivery of the vehicle at the Port of Bremerhaven. He later had the car professionally rustproofed in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The car reportedly attracted significant attention, with local police often stopping his wife just to admire the vehicle. After approximately 6, 000 miles of use overseas, the car was brought back to the United States in early 1970. Since then, it has had only two other owners: Michael Pettitt from 1985 to 1995, and John Pelletier from 1995 to 2021. This T5 is powered by a completely rebuilt with receipts 351 cubic inch V8 engine mated to a Ford FMX 3-speed automatic transmission and comes equipped with air conditioning, power brakes, power steering, aluminum wheels, AM/FM radio, seatbelts, radial tires, and a mix of cloth and vinyl upholstery. As a T5, it features the required unique badging and branding that replaced all Mustang references, making it a one-of-a-kind vehicle with direct ties to Cold War-era export policy and military history. T5 Mustangs were only produced in small numbers, and Ford did not maintain precise production records. Estimates suggest that fewer than 300 of these export models have been located and verified today. This particular car's traceable ownership and early documentation make it especially noteworthy. For collectors seeking a distinctive variation of the 1969 Mach 1, this German-delivery Ford T5 offers a compelling combination of rarity, provenance, and historical importance. 1 of 1 Elite Marti Report Included. Over $25k in recent maintenance receipts are included with the sale of the car from 2023 to now.

Toyota,FJ Cruiser,1978,0000000FJ40269116,63000,13690,Manual,I6,Red,,suv,"Gateway Classic Cars of Tampa presents this amazing 1978 Toyota FJ Cruiser. This iconic overlander is a testament to the rugged, reliable and versatile reputation of the famous Toyota FJ series of 4x4s. This red beauty is a Bolivian import and was blessed with a full mechanical overhaul. It now packs a 4200cc inline six with a bored block and matching pistons, plus all new rotating assembly and associated components. To ensure this 4200 six can get the most of its displacement, a Davis Unified Ignition handles spark and timing duty with a boost in power and reliability. It's far more efficient and simpler - a great upgrade. All that Spark is useless without fuel, but this 4200cc six is fed with a multi-point fuel injection system too. This 78 FJ is now a powerhouse of a 4x4! The engine literally yanks this truck around in manner the original motor never did. A fresh stainless steal exhaust helps the FJ breath and gives a lovely exhaust note. All this power is transmitted though a completely rebuilt transmission with new gears, bearings, shift forks and clutch. Externally the Red FJ has a great presence. It's got a rust-free, bright red body with white roof and grill sitting on a set of 35x11 15inch BF Goodrich tires wrapped around factory 15"" wheels. The front winch and off-roading jack and chrome tow hook give the Jeep a rugged and ready vibe this 4x4 can easily back up. Inside it's all business with cloth seats front and rear, rubber floor mats, and a nice dash with the standard grey gauges for functional simplicity. All the gauges work and when you glance around the rear there's a roll bar for added safety in the event of a rollover. In conclusion this FJ is an amazing example of the breed with all the upgrades for functionality and performance with none of the compromises. It's ready to go; drives great and can do hard work, or casual beach cruising. It's nice enough to serve as a collection piece or even show duty. These are great 4x4s and this 1978 FJ will make everyone happy. Make it yours today First Name Please provide a first name. Last Name Please provide a last name.

While it may LOOK like an '81 Turbo T/A on the outside, it's come far from its original configuration. According to the (included) original build sheet, this little beast was originally red, in and out. It was part of a custom ProTouring build, done in Florida around 2012. Since its current owner purchased it, he had almost everything done over on it, as the build had aged a bit. About the only thing he didn't have ""touched"" were the engine and transmission internals. The car came with its unique rear opening hood already set up, but over the years, its alignment had gotten off kilter slightly, so during the teardown and updates installation at Classic Cars of Houston, that was adjusted. Under the hood is a built LS2, which reportedly is sending 511 crank HP through the Tremec T56 6-speed manual to the 10-bolt rear with its 3.73:1 PosiTrac-enhanced gears, netting 419 RWHP. That's plenty of power to light those 245/45ZR17 Mickey Thompson radials up whenever you want! And, if you're unable to control your desire to smoke the tires, one nice thing about the setup is that they are the same size at all four corners, so you can rotate them at least once before having to buy a rear set. Some key updates include a complete Detroit Speed (DSE) hydroformed front clip (which has been powdercoated), new DSE engine mounts, single adjustable shocks, new tubular control arms, new sway bars, all urethane suspension bushings, new DSE solid body mounts, new Wilwood 6-piston front calipers with slotted multipiece front rotors, drilled and slotted rear rotors, and the custom 17-inch snowflake pattern aluminum wheels that look like the originals, but are 2 inches larger diameter. Classic Cars of Houston (CCH) also added an LS Front Runner setup with power steering, DSE hard line kit, new Gen 4 Vintage Air, updated the brake lines to all stainless steel, installed subframe connectors, revised the rear suspension from its former 2-inch drop to a more ride-friendly 1-inch drop, installed stainless shorty headers with V-band connection to the new stainless dual exhaust (which also has stainless mufflers), installed a larger Griffin aluminum radiator with twin electric fans and a proper fitment for the LS engine's steam port. The upgrade to the DSE front clip also necessitated a revision to the driveshaft length and the transmission tunnel, as well as a new transmission crossmember, so as things were resized and reinstalled, extensive use of DynaMat was implemented to reduce cabin noise. In the cabin, due to the transmission tunnel reconfiguration, the center console was reconfigured, and the shifter was enhanced with 1-inch shorter throws. With the many changes, CCH also elected to install a new complete wiring harness tailored for the revisions. Inside, the driver is greeted by the new Dakota Digital dash behind the tilt steering wheel, and front occupants will enjoy the two-tone leather covered power seats. Rear passengers get the same two-tone leather treatment, but they'll not likely enjoy riding out back for long (unless they're car-loving kids that fit in the seats without being scrunched in, of course). In addition to the upgraded interior, audiophiles will enjoy the powered Focal subwoofer, and the amazing sound quality that the Mosconi amp pushes through the Focal 6X9 speakers in the rear and Virtus Nano Morel front component speakers. Of course, a new Alpine head unit starts the flow of aural enjoyment, but audiophiles know it's those Focal speakers that make the sound so clear. Everyone in the cabin will enjoy the new Vintage Air HVAC, which provides year-round comfort. This is one extreme ProTouring build, which provides the look of a vintage F-body with the performance of a modern LS-powered muscle car. Unlike many, this one comes with a nearly 3-inch-thick binder of receipts, the original build sheet, lots of build documentation photos, original owner's manual, you'll have a laundry list of ""what's what and how much it cost"" to peruse. Its current owner's receipts and build info from CCH total out to over $66, 500 in parts and labor, which breaks down to over $36K for nearly 400 hours of customization labor during the refresh in 2018-1019, and $30K in parts.

Ford,Tudor Sedan,1933,00000000B80411999,61000,2406,4-Speed Automatic,5.7L V8,Purple,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars Houston Showroom is excited to present this very custom all steel 1933 Ford Tudor Sedan. This sweet ride is no trailer queen, either - with a tick over 2400 miles on it, it's clearly built to be driven to all of the shows it's going to win! Suffice it to say that space limitations will apply to how much detail we can go into on this car, because it is one of the most intricately thought out (and executed) custom street rods we've had the pleasure of hosting! There are two giant 3-ring binders with over 1000 photos chronicling the project's build, and a large expandable portfolio full of receipts and operating instructions for many of the parts and systems. The beautiful purple paint is by PPG, and although there is a ""Spray Out Card"" with the final color, it does not identify the color code. But don't let that distract you from the exceptional paint and body work - there's nary a ripple or wave, and the finish is smooth as glass. As your eyes wander all over, in, and under this car, you'll notice that virtually everything is either chromed, ceramic coated, or powder coated and buffed to a high gloss. Some of the contributors involved in the build and subsequent additional customization include Pro Design Hotrods (Santa Ana, CA); Angel's Body Shop (paint and body work, located in Montclair, CA); Bitchin Products (battery box, floor pan, and firewall); Lokar (hand brake, flex dipstick); Mission Plastics (custom designed and manufactured parts, Ontario, CA); Walton Fabrication (Upland, CA); Tempe Speed and Performance (Tempe, AZ); Rootlieb, Inc. (steel reproduction panels); Rocky Hinge (power door locks, bear claw latches); Vintage Air (HVAC); and Zig's Street Rods (power windows). Under the custom front opening hood lurks a small block Chevrolet 5.7L V8, backed by a 4-speed automatic transmission, which is controlled by a Mooneyes Smart Shift pushbutton system. The 5.7L LT1 is a ""Serpentine Show Chrome Short TPI"" package by Street & Performance from Mena, AR, and there is so much chrome and polished billet aluminum in the engine bay that you could blind yourself. Exhaust is handled by a completely ceramic coated MagnaFlow modular system. This gorgeous '33 is sitting on a custom powder coated chassis featuring an integrated driveshaft safety loop (mfr. unknown but may be by Total Cost Involved). The frame has also been powder coated in a complementary shade of lighter purple. It features a fully adjustable coilover suspension, with polished chrome upper and lower control arms up front, Mustang II-style steering rack, fully adjustable multilink rear, slotted/drilled rotors with polished multi-piston calipers at each corner, and a Ford 9"" rear with limited slip differential. It's riding on a set of Halibrand billet aluminum wheels (custom specified and built for this car), which are wrapped with performance radial tires. After you've thoroughly soaked up the attention to detail evident in the exterior, engine bay, and undercarriage, you'll want to hop in and hit the highway to show it off! Open the suicide doors and notice the aroma of fine leather that will waft into your nostrils. The seats are covered in a combination of leather, perforated leather, and Alcantara. The gray carpet is in great condition, and the gray Alcantara headliner adds a luxury touch. Drivers will appreciate the ability to tailor their driving position thanks to the power seat and the Flaming River tilt steering column, and the front passenger will appreciate their power seat. Custom billet aluminum dash panels house Classic Instruments electronic gauges on the left behind the Flaming River banjo-style steering wheel, and the clock on the right. A Classic Instruments ""Sky Drive"" GPS speedometer sender helps ensure accurate speed control, which is a good thing, because you'll want to turn up the wick every so often, and the attention this car gets on the road might attract more than just admirers. A custom sound system is hidden behind the rear seat and features a Kenwood KDC-352U AM/FM/CD head unit, Pioneer HD Radio tuner, Infinity Reference speaker controllers, a Pioneer subwoofer, and JL Audio 500W amp (2x100W front, 2x25W rear, 1x250W subwoofer). The Optima battery is tucked securely away back there as well and is housed in a Bitchin Products aluminum battery box. As you'll see if you visit the complete ad for the car on our website, we have over 150 photos of this masterpiece, along with the documentation that will come with it.

Chevrolet,Corvette,1968,0000194378S428006,59000,58298,Manual,V8,Orange,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars Houston Showroom is proud to present this 1968 Chevrolet Corvette. The 1968 Chevrolet Corvette (L36) marks the birth of the third generation, known as the C3, a turning point in the Corvette's lineage. That year, Chevrolet introduced a completely redesigned body, reimagined interior, and new roof options. Coupes gained removable T-top roof panels and a removable rear window, allowing for a semi-open air experience. The front styling adopted a longer, more pointed nose, with vacuum-operated hideaway headlights and flush door handles with push-button releases. Behind the front wheels are functional louvers, and a new ventilation system dubbed ""Astro-Ventilation"" was added. Before you is a bronze 1968 Corvette that carries those C3 hallmarks boldly. Its exterior Bronze paint catches light so that the sweeping curves-from the coved fenders to the rear hips-stand out in every direction. The roof includes T-tops, which when removed open up the cabin overhead for a fresh air drive. The profile shows the front fender vents and the stretched silhouette, recalling how Chevrolet reshaped the Corvette for that model year. Inside the car, the interior is trimmed in black vinyl. The seats, dashboard, and door panels present that classic contrast of the bold exterior and darker cabin. A working AM/FM radio resides in the dash, offering that period-appropriate sound. On the safety front there are seat belts provided for occupants. Mechanically this Corvette is equipped with a 427 CID V8 engine mated to a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission. Power steering aids control and maneuvering, and power brakes are fitted. The wheels wear hub caps over radial tires that accent the car's footprint, and the overall stance gives a sense of the Corvette's sporting ambitions without overstatement. This is a car that embodies the 1968-C3 Corvette style features: the aggressive lines, the dramatic roof options, the presence of performance-oriented systems like power steering and brakes, and the interior designed for driver engagement. If you appreciate automotive design, collectible value, or simply the joy of driving a Chevrolet classic, this orange 1968 Corvette shows a lot of what makes that generation special.

Plymouth,Road Runner,1969,0000RM21H9G236283,58000,2157,3-Speed Automatic,440 CID V8,Black,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars Houston Showroom is excited to present this very nasty 1969 Plymouth Road Runner for sale. Introduced in 1968 as a trim level for the Plymouth Belvedere, the Road Runner was designed to be a ""no frills"" muscle car, just a simple car with a big engine. Trim-wise, it was fit between the highest trim GTX and the slightly lower trim-level Satellite. The Road Runner sold double its expected numbers in the first year, becoming a tremendous success! This Road Runner is painted a dark purple metalflake that's so dark it looks black under most lighting, so whenever you take it to your cruise meets, you'll want to bring some extra lights to shine on it to bring out that sparkle - it's quite something! There's even a slightly lighter purple ghost flame treatment around the blower opening in the hood, which really pops in bright light. The chrome trim has all been treated to the same paint, furthering the ""midnight assassin"" look of this gnarly street terrorizer. This Road Runner has taken the concept of ""giant engine in a bare-bones performance car"" a few steps further than the norm. For starters, this beast does have the largest displacement engine that could be had in a Mopar in 1969, but the massive 440 CID V8 (that sits mostly) under the hood has been punched out .030"", filled with goodies, and topped with dual Holley 4BBL carbs, a giant BDS blower and an NOS plate nitrous system. The mill is equipped with ported and polished aluminum Edelbrock Performer RPM heads, a Callies forged crankshaft, Eagle connecting rods, Diamond pistons, and Clevite bearings. It's kept cool by a giant aluminum radiator with twin electric fans. Chromed long tube headers feed into the dual 4"" exhaust, providing a very muscular sound. Although the supercharger is pushing 10psi of boost, neither we nor its owner know what the NOS system is jetted to (he's never used it), so getting an idea of what it's capable of putting down on the dyno will require some fiddling around with different NOS jets. However, let's just say that this bad boy is already putting down some serious torque where the massive 33X18.50-15LT M/T ET Street slicks meet the pavement. Behind the huge blower-topped 440 is a performance built 727 TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission, which has a reverse manual valve body configuration: a great setup for those trips down the 1320, which this car has been built for. Out back, the Dana 60 rear has been filled with a set of 4.88:1 gears, so this baby's quick off the line when you drop the hammer! Drivers will immediately recognize the Line Lock switch and NOS buttons on the shifter, and may find themselves wanting to see ""what this thing feels like at WOT a lot"" (couldn't resist a little rhyme regarding the wide open throttle actuation of the NOS)...If the driver likes to be running WOT frequently, they'll be grateful for the Wilwood multi-piston calipers hiding behind the Weld Racing wheels up front; which, along with the heavy duty Mopar finned drums out back, help bring this brawling beast to a stop quickly. The front tires are 28X7.50-15LT M/T Sportsman skinnies, and with the huge M/T ""cheater slicks"" out back, go a long way toward providing that vintage late 1960's muscle car stance and overall look. Inside, the rear passenger area has been ""reconfigured slightly"", because with its tubbed back half and 8-point roll cage, there's no longer a rear seat! Instead, that area is now nicely carpeted and/or covered in black synthetic leather. In front, the buckets are done in black woven fabric with synthetic leather trim and are equipped with multi-point RJS Racing harnesses. The overhead console area contains all the necessary switches for starting this beast up and keeping it lit, and a full complement of AutoMeter gauges (tach, boost pressure, fuel pressure, oil pressure, volts, and water temp) help the driver monitor critical systems' status. Out back, a fully adjustable multi-link Chassis Engineering rear drag suspension helps this hulking B-body plant all that big 440's blown power to the ground and keep it pointed down the track. If you're looking for that classic 1960's era Mopar muscle car that has a little extra lagniappe, you've found it. Call our Houston showroom to make it yours! First Name Please provide a first name.

Chevrolet,Camaro,1968,0000124678N310581,58000,65676,Turbo 350,350ci L48,Red,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars of Tampa is proud to digitally present this gorgeous 1968 Chevrolet Camaro SS convertible. The consignor believes this beauty to be an original SS. However, for those in the know, that's not's easy to prove unless you have solid paperwork i.e. window sticker or build sheet. Chevrolet only made 2, 750 SS Camaro convertibles in 1968 so there aren't many real ones riding around today. What we do know is this is a factory""12467"" V8 convertible from the start. Despite what some may say, GM Vins don't always tell you exactly what a car is or isn't in terms of coveted options. We can, however, see the Vin on the title also stamped on the front engine pad of the 350ci (Casting #3914678 L48 MU 295HP). Take a look underneath and you'll find the bullet proof 12 bolt rear diff. Depending on who you speak to, some say all SS cars had the famed rear diff while other experts say that may not be correct. You be the judge. The consignor has owned the car for over two decades and states it was fully restored in the 1990s just before he purchased it. He states it is not an original red car and has a box of receipts for the new owner. Before bringing the car to Gateway, the consigner had some front end work done and a new top installed. One thing is for sure, this '68 Camaro drives and looks great! Come and see this one for yourself at our Tampa location. First Name Please provide a first name. Last Name Please provide a last name.

Chevrolet,Chevelle,1969,0000136379K328514,57000,51113,4-spd,396 V8,Brown,,car,"Gateway Classic Cars of Tampa is proud to digitally present this beautiful 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle. Guys let's jump right in on this one. There are more SS Camaro's and Chevelle's today than ever produced. How is that possible? Because many are fake and some are very well done. In 1969, GM changed how and what VIN numbers disclosed. ""13637"" does NOT mean this Chevelle is or is not a true SS for the '69 models. At the bottom of the cowl tag you will find the mythical, ""L."" Depending on who you listen too, some Chevy guys state for 1969, this indicates an authentic Super Sport while others disagree. Look gents here's the bottom line, unless you have the original window sticker or build sheet there's no way to prove a '69 SS is genuine so buyer beware. The consignor believes it is, but we can't verify the claim. That said, let's stick to what we know. This is a true ""65"" Olympic Gold car with the correct black interior and when combined with a black vinyl top creates an eye catching combination. Under the hood you'll find legendary big block Chevy power (casting number 3989854 or 3939854 it's hard to tell). At some point, the powerplant has been in the hands of a machine shop as the vin number is missing from the front pad, so we don't know if this is the original engine. Out back, a 4speed transmission and 12-bolt rear differential work in harmony to put the power and torque to the ground. This is a very nice driver quality car, and not a trailer Queen, that's been well cared for. This one puts the muscle in muscle car. First Name Please provide a first name.

If you are in Kerala, you call it a Pappadam. If you are in Tamil Nadu, you call it an Appalam. If you are in north India, you might call it a Papad. Other states call this tasty treat by even other names! Usually served with the meal (like potato chips would be served in the U.S.) they are also served as a starter or appetizer. They are usually made from lentil flour like urud dal and chickpeas or rice with oil, salt and perhaps baking soda to make them light. Some are plain while others are flavored. Once the dough is made they are rolled out into very thin circles and then dried in the sun. In North India, Pappadams or Papads, are made with urud dal and sometimes with other primary ingredients. Often they are spiced with coarsely ground black pepper, cumin seeds or red chili flakes. These can be fried, roasted over a flame or microwaved. They are thin and remain flat when cooked and are 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Their texture is crunchy and crispy. These Appalams of Tamil Nadu are usually not often served in restaurants everywhere, so you may not be familiar with them. Made of urad dal, they do not have any added spices. Like their North Indian counterparts, these do well fried, roasted and microwaved. At 5 inches in diameter, their most striking difference is their texture and color. These are light tan and have a very smooth finish. When cooked, they have a delicate crunch.||Normal Warehouse Temperature||Fry and eat|India|NA||||Energy 181 kcal, protien 26g, carbs 60g|Energy 181 kcal, protien 26g, carbs 60g|||||||||||||||Chips & Corn Snacks||||||||||||||3.8|19.0||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvqlh4vkvv/veganic-appalam-papadam-400gm-south-indian-apalam-papad-madurai-plain-rice-urid-aplam-happala-chawal-ke-papad-ready-to-cook-best-with-lunch-dinner-evening-snacks-product-images-orvqlh4vkvv-p596643925-0-202212261254.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvqlh4vkvv/veganic-appalam-papadam-400gm-south-indian-apalam-papad-madurai-plain-rice-urid-aplam-happala-chawal-ke-papad-ready-to-cook-best-with-lunch-dinner-evening-snacks-product-images-orvqlh4vkvv-p596643925-1-202212261254.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvqlh4vkvv/veganic-appalam-papadam-400gm-south-indian-apalam-papad-madurai-plain-rice-urid-aplam-happala-chawal-ke-papad-ready-to-cook-best-with-lunch-dinner-evening-snacks-product-images-orvqlh4vkvv-p596643925-2-202212261254.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: Veganic, Manufacturer: Veganic, Manufacturer Address: Veganic, Manufacturer Email: hello@veganicmart.com, Manufacturer Website: www.veganicmart.com, Sold By: Veganic, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Country of Origin: India, Best Before: 26-12-2023, Product Type: Chips & Corn Snacks, How To Use: Fry and eat, Storage Category: Normal storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Ingredients: Black Gram (Urad) Flour, Rice Flour, Salt, Edible Veg Oil, Nutrient Content: Energy 181 kcal, protien 26g, carbs 60g, Food Preference: Veg, FSSAI Number: 23321005000351, Additives: salt, Dietary Preference: Gluten Free, Allergens Included: NA, Color: white, Hazardous Material: No, Flavor: crispy salted, Pack Of: 1, Base Ingredient: Rice, Caloric Value: 181, Caloric Value - Measuring Unit: 181, Regional Speciality: Telugu, Oil Used: yes, Country Of Origin: india, Manufacturing Process: Vegan, Net Quantity: 400 g, Height: 10 cm, Length: 18 cm, Width: 12 cm, Net Weight: 400 g|Gluten Free|Veganic||Veganic||||||||400 g|Black Gram (Urad) Flour, Rice Flour, Salt, Edible Veg Oil||True||596643925P||||||||

They are so delicious that they would not even last for 6 months :) These were the best tasting potato chips ever And we enjoyed helping her too: waking up early morning with the sunrise and helping peel potatoes, spreading the cloth or dupatta on the terrace and securing the corners of the cloth with heavy stones or bricks, and then running around to shoo away the birds while the chips would be drying out :) Yes, we grew up with all that fun during summer break, and were rewarded with aloo fryums crispy and yummy snacks. :) Those are the best childhood memories.||Normal Warehouse Temperature||ready to fry|India|NA||||carbs 26 kcal, protein 3g fiber 2g|carbs 26 kcal, protein 3g fiber 2g|||||||||||||||Chips & Corn Snacks||||||||||||||3.1|54.0||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvvgjc7vez/veganic-potato-net-papad-aloo-jaali-homemade-papad-alu-chips-jali-aaloo-fryums-potato-wafers-product-images-orvvgjc7vez-p596893851-0-202301031419.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvvgjc7vez/veganic-potato-net-papad-aloo-jaali-homemade-papad-alu-chips-jali-aaloo-fryums-potato-wafers-product-images-orvvgjc7vez-p596893851-1-202301031420.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvvgjc7vez/veganic-potato-net-papad-aloo-jaali-homemade-papad-alu-chips-jali-aaloo-fryums-potato-wafers-product-images-orvvgjc7vez-p596893851-2-202301031420.jpg?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: Veganic, Manufacturer: Veganic, Manufacturer Address: Veganic, Manufacturer Email: hello@veganicmart.com, Manufacturer Website: www.veganicmart.com, Sold By: Veganic, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Country of Origin: India, Best Before: 27-12-2023, Product Type: Chips & Corn Snacks, How To Use: ready to fry, Storage Category: Normal storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Ingredients: potato, salt, Nutrient Content: carbs 26 kcal, protein 3g fiber 2g, Food Preference: Veg, FSSAI Number: 23321005000351, Additives: salt, Dietary Preference: Gluten Free, Allergens Included: NA, Color: white, Hazardous Material: No, Flavor: Salted, Pack Of: 1, Base Ingredient: Potato, Container Type: Pouch, Organic: No, Caloric Value: 371, Caloric Value - Measuring Unit: kcal, Regional Speciality: Others, Oil Used: No, Baked: No, Country Of Origin: india, Manufacturing Process: Vegan, Net Quantity: 200 g, Height: 5 cm, Length: 18 cm, Width: 12 cm, Net Weight: 200 g|Gluten Free|Veganic||Veganic||||||||200 g|potato, salt||True||596893851P||||||||

Made from ripe bananas, this namkeen offers a unique and flavorful snacking experience that is both satisfying and suitable for fasting. The preparation of Falahari Banana Chips Namkeen involves slicing ripe bananas into thin rounds, which are then deep-fried to perfection. The frying process transforms the bananas into crispy chips with a golden brown color. The result is a crunchy and addictive snack with a subtle sweetness that comes from the natural sugars present in the ripe bananas. Falahari Banana Chips Namkeen ideal for fasting is that it adheres to specific dietary restrictions. It does not contain ingredients like onion, garlic, or grains that are typically avoided during fasting periods. This snack is also free from any non-vegetarian ingredients, making it suitable for a wide range of dietary preferences. Falahari Banana Chips Namkeen can be enjoyed on its own as a tasty and satisfying snack during fasting or can be paired with other falahari items like fruit chaat or yogurt to create a complete and balanced meal.

Protein is important for building and repairing tissues in the body and can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. , 2. Rich in fiber: Chickpeas are also a good source of fiber, with about 6-7 grams per 1/2 cup serving.

It is made from gram flour, spices, and oil, which are mixed together to form a dough. This dough is then shaped into thin, noodle-like strands and deep-fried until crispy. The history of Ratlami sev dates back to the early 19th century when it was first made by the Marwari community in Ratlam. The Marwaris were known for their business acumen and their love for good food, and they created the sev as a snack that could be easily transported and stored for long periods. Over the years, Ratlami sev has become a beloved snack across India, with people from all regions enjoying its unique taste and texture. One of the key ingredients that give Ratlami sev its distinct flavor is the use of a special spice blend called the Ratlami masala. This masala is made from a combination of spices like cumin, coriander, fennel, black pepper, and cloves, which are roasted and ground together. The masala is then mixed with the dough to give the sev its spicy and flavorful taste. Another unique aspect of Ratlami sev is the use of a special technique called the ""double-frying"" method. After the dough is shaped into thin strands, it is first fried at a low temperature until it is cooked through. It is then removed from the oil, cooled, and fried again at a higher temperature until it becomes crispy and golden brown. This gives the sev its signature crunchy texture. In addition to its delicious taste, Ratlami sev also has some nutritional value. It is a good source of protein, fiber, and carbohydrates, which can help provide energy and keep you feeling full for longer. However, it is also high in calories and fat, so it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Ratlami sev is a tasty and unique snack that has become a favorite of many people in India and around the world. Its spicy and crunchy taste, combined with its easy portability and long shelf life, make it a perfect snack for any occasion. Whether you enjoy it on its own or as a topping on other dishes, Ratlami sev is sure to satisfy your craving for a delicious and flavorful snack."||Normal Warehouse Temperature||Eat at Tea time or with meal|India|NA||||Refer pack|Refer pack|||||||||||||||Namkeen & Savoury Snacks|||||||||||||||||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvt98kws5x/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-namkeen-besan-bhujia-long-sev-snack-ratlami-namkeen-sev-indore-s-famous-ratlami-sev-crispy-crunchy-medium-spicy-lightly-spiced-flavorful-perfect-topping-for-all-food-chaat-150g-2pack-product-images-orvt98kws5x-p600871892-0-202304241914.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvt98kws5x/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-namkeen-besan-bhujia-long-sev-snack-ratlami-namkeen-sev-indore-s-famous-ratlami-sev-crispy-crunchy-medium-spicy-lightly-spiced-flavorful-perfect-topping-for-all-food-chaat-150g-2pack-product-images-orvt98kws5x-p600871892-1-202304241914.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvt98kws5x/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-namkeen-besan-bhujia-long-sev-snack-ratlami-namkeen-sev-indore-s-famous-ratlami-sev-crispy-crunchy-medium-spicy-lightly-spiced-flavorful-perfect-topping-for-all-food-chaat-150g-2pack-product-images-orvt98kws5x-p600871892-2-202304241914.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: CHANGEZI’S BAWARCHI KHANA, Manufacturer: Laddu Gopal Food Products, Manufacturer Address: Laddu Gopal Food Products, Manufacturer Email: laddugopalfoodproducts@gmail.com, Sold By: LADDU GOPAL FOOD PRODUCTS, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Included Components: 2, Country of Origin: India, Product Type: Namkeen & Savoury Snacks, How To Use: Eat at Tea time or with meal, Storage Category: Normal storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Food Preference: Veg, Ingredients: All home made Ingredients, Nutrient Content: Refer pack, FSSAI Number: 12220026001879, Additives: NA, Dietary Preference: Dairy Free, Allergens Included: NA, Transportation: General transport, Flavor: Rich Namkeen Snack, Container Type: Pouch, Added Preservatives: No, Oil Used: Ground Nut Oil, Country Of Origin: India, Gift Pack: No, Manufacturing Process: Vegan, Net Quantity: 1 Pieces, Height: 4 cm, Length: 20 cm, Width: 12 cm, Net Weight: 300 g|Dairy Free|Laddu Gopal Food Products||LADDU GOPAL FOOD PRODUCTS||||||||1 Pieces|All home made Ingredients||True||600871892P||||||||

Fiki Boondi is prepared by first making a smooth batter with besan, water, and a pinch of salt. The batter is whisked until it reaches a thin, pouring consistency. The batter is then poured through a special utensil called a boondi jhara or perforated ladle, with small holes, over hot oil. As the batter falls through the holes into the hot oil, small droplets of boondi form. The boondi is deep-fried until it turns golden brown and becomes crispy. Once fried, the boondi is carefully removed from the oil and drained to remove any excess oil. Plain boondi refers to the original form of Fiki Boondi without any added spices. It has a simple, mild flavor and a neutral taste, allowing it to be used in various ways. Fiki Boondi has a crispy texture that provides a satisfying crunch with every bite. The small droplets of boondi offer a delightful mouthfeel. Fiki Boondi is a versatile namkeen snack that can be enjoyed in various ways. It can be consumed as a standalone snack, used as a topping for chaats, added to yogurt to make raita, or included in snack mixes to add crunch and flavor. Fiki Boondi is often used as an ingredient in snack mixes, along with other namkeen snacks, nuts, and spices. It adds a unique texture and flavor element to the mix. Remember to store Fiki Boondi in an airtight container to maintain its crispness.||Normal Warehouse Temperature||Eat at Tea time or with meal or as snacks|India|NA||||Refer pack|Refer pack|||||||||||||||Namkeen & Savoury Snacks|||||||||||||||||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rviiqzalye/ghotaram-fiki-boondi-raita-boondi-snacks-plain-boondi-nugrey-crunchy-snacks-rajasthani-boondi-sada-plain-yellow-boondi-fresh-bundi-yogurt-curd-buttermilk-bundi-350g-1pack-product-images-orviiqzalye-p603102040-0-202307171351.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rviiqzalye/ghotaram-fiki-boondi-raita-boondi-snacks-plain-boondi-nugrey-crunchy-snacks-rajasthani-boondi-sada-plain-yellow-boondi-fresh-bundi-yogurt-curd-buttermilk-bundi-350g-1pack-product-images-orviiqzalye-p603102040-1-202307171352.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rviiqzalye/ghotaram-fiki-boondi-raita-boondi-snacks-plain-boondi-nugrey-crunchy-snacks-rajasthani-boondi-sada-plain-yellow-boondi-fresh-bundi-yogurt-curd-buttermilk-bundi-350g-1pack-product-images-orviiqzalye-p603102040-2-202307171352.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: GHOTARAM, Manufacturer: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, Manufacturer Address: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, Manufacturer Email: ghotaramfoodproducts@gmail.com, Sold By: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Included Components: 1, Country of Origin: India, Product Type: Namkeen & Savoury Snacks, How To Use: Eat at Tea time or with meal or as snacks, Storage Category: Isolated Storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Food Preference: Veg, Ingredients: All home made ingredients, Nutrient Content: Refer pack, FSSAI Number: 12223026000251, Additives: NA, Dietary Preference: Dairy Free, Allergens Included: NA, Flavor: Crunchy Crispy Namkeen Snack, Taste: Salty, Container Type: Pouch, Regional Speciality: Rajastani, Oil Used: Ground Nut Oil, Country Of Origin: India, Manufacturing Process: Cruelty-Free, Benefits: Chakli snacks are spiral-shaped and crispy snacks that are popular in All over India.

This delicious snack offers a delightful combination of crunchy texture, tangy spices, and the distinct aroma of asafoetida. To prepare this enticing treat, chickpeas are carefully selected and roasted to perfection. The roasting process gives them a crispy texture and enhances their natural nutty flavor.

These spices lend a zesty and tangy taste to the snack, making it a mouthwatering treat. The result is a snack that provides a satisfying crunch, a burst of flavors, and a unique twist from the asafoetida. The combination of spices creates a harmonious balance of heat, tanginess, and savory notes that elevate the taste of the roasted chickpeas. This snack is perfect for munching on its own. The crispy texture and savory taste make it an ideal option to satisfy snack cravings between meals. Roasted Masala Hing Chana Namkeen is a popular choice for parties, get-togethers, or social gatherings.

While this snack is enjoyed for its taste and texture, it also offers some potential health benefits, such as: 1. High in protein: Chickpeas, the main ingredient in chana jor garam, are a good source of protein, with about 7-8 grams of protein per 1/2 cup serving. Protein is important for building and repairing tissues in the body and can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. , 2. Rich in fiber: Chickpeas are also a good source of fiber, with about 6-7 grams per 1/2 cup serving. Fiber can help promote digestive health, regulate blood sugar levels, and lower cholesterol levels. , 3. Low in fat: chana jor garam can be a low-fat snack. Roasted or air-fried versions can be a healthier alternative to deep-fried varieties. , 4. Chana Jor Garam Contains essential nutrients: Chickpeas are a good source of several essential nutrients, including iron, folate, and manganese, which are important for maintaining healthy blood cells, supporting brain function, and regulating metabolism.Overall, while chana jor garam should be enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, it can offer some potential health benefits when consumed in moderation as a snack.||Normal Warehouse Temperature||Eat at tea time or with meal|India|NA||||Refer pack|Refer pack|||||||||||||||Namkeen & Savoury Snacks|||||||||||||||||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvk2vfjy1e/ghotaram-gfp-gluten-free-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-healthy-gujarati-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-roasted-snack-ready-to-eat-guilt-free-snack-250-3pack-product-images-orvk2vfjy1e-p600831592-0-202304230256.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvk2vfjy1e/ghotaram-gfp-gluten-free-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-healthy-gujarati-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-roasted-snack-ready-to-eat-guilt-free-snack-250-3pack-product-images-orvk2vfjy1e-p600831592-1-202304230256.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvk2vfjy1e/ghotaram-gfp-gluten-free-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-healthy-gujarati-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-roasted-snack-ready-to-eat-guilt-free-snack-250-3pack-product-images-orvk2vfjy1e-p600831592-2-202304230256.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: GHOTARAM, Manufacturer: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, Manufacturer Address: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, Manufacturer Email: ghotaramfoodproducts@gmail.com, Sold By: GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Included Components: 3, Country of Origin: India, Product Type: Namkeen & Savoury Snacks, How To Use: Eat at tea time or with meal, Storage Category: Normal storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Food Preference: Veg, Ingredients: All home made ingredients, Nutrient Content: Refer pack, FSSAI Number: 12223026000251, Additives: NA, Dietary Preference: Dairy Free, Allergens Included: NA, Transportation: General transport, Flavor: Rich Namkeen Snack, Container Type: Pouch, Added Preservatives: No, Oil Used: Ground Nut Oil, Country Of Origin: India, Gift Pack: No, Manufacturing Process: Vegan, Net Quantity: 750Gm, Height: 4 cm, Length: 10 cm, Width: 8 cm, Net Weight: 750 g|Dairy Free|GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS||GHOTARAM FOOD PRODUCTS||||||||750Gm|All home made ingredients||True||600831592P||||||||

While this snack is enjoyed for its taste and texture, it also offers some potential health benefits, such as: 1. High in protein: Chickpeas, the main ingredient in chana jor garam, are a good source of protein, with about 7-8 grams of protein per 1/2 cup serving. Protein is important for building and repairing tissues in the body and can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. , 2. Rich in fiber: Chickpeas are also a good source of fiber, with about 6-7 grams per 1/2 cup serving. Fiber can help promote digestive health, regulate blood sugar levels, and lower cholesterol levels. , 3. Low in fat: chana jor garam can be a low-fat snack. Roasted or air-fried versions can be a healthier alternative to deep-fried varieties. , 4. Chana Jor Garam Contains essential nutrients: Chickpeas are a good source of several essential nutrients, including iron, folate, and manganese, which are important for maintaining healthy blood cells, supporting brain function, and regulating metabolism.Overall, while chana jor garam should be enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, it can offer some potential health benefits when consumed in moderation as a snack.||Normal Warehouse Temperature||Eat at Tea time or with meal|India|NA||||Refer pack|Refer pack|||||||||||||||Namkeen & Savoury Snacks||||||||||||||3.0|1.0||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvat7gjhka/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-oil-free-protein-rich-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-gluten-free-chana-jhor-garam-healthy-baked-roasted-namkeen-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-1kg-1pack-product-images-orvat7gjhka-p600799317-0-202304241450.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvat7gjhka/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-oil-free-protein-rich-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-gluten-free-chana-jhor-garam-healthy-baked-roasted-namkeen-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-1kg-1pack-product-images-orvat7gjhka-p600799317-1-202304241450.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||https://www.jiomart.com/images/product/original/rvat7gjhka/changezi-s-bawarchi-khana-oil-free-protein-rich-low-fat-black-chana-jor-garam-namkeen-snacks-for-diet-gluten-free-chana-jhor-garam-healthy-baked-roasted-namkeen-snack-farsan-snacks-namkeen-1kg-1pack-product-images-orvat7gjhka-p600799317-2-202304241450.png?im=Resize=(150,150)||||||||||Brand: CHANGEZI’S BAWARCHI KHANA, Manufacturer: Laddu Gopal Food Products, Manufacturer Address: Laddu Gopal Food Products, Manufacturer Email: laddugopalfoodproducts@gmail.com, Sold By: LADDU GOPAL FOOD PRODUCTS, JioMart Customer Care Phone: 1800 890 1222, Included Components: 1, Country of Origin: India, Product Type: Namkeen & Savoury Snacks, How To Use: Eat at Tea time or with meal, Storage Category: Normal storage, Storage Temperature Limit (in Degree Celsius): Normal Warehouse Temperature, Food Preference: Veg, Ingredients: All home made Ingredients, Nutrient Content: Refer pack, FSSAI Number: 12220026001879, Additives: NA, Dietary Preference: Dairy Free, Allergens Included: NA, Transportation: General transport, Flavor: Rich Namkeen Snack, Container Type: Pouch, Added Preservatives: No, Oil Used: Ground Nut Oil, Country Of Origin: India, Gift Pack: No, Manufacturing Process: Vegan, Net Quantity: 1 Pieces, Height: 4 cm, Length: 20 cm, Width: 12 cm, Net Weight: 1000 g|Dairy Free|Laddu Gopal Food Products||LADDU GOPAL FOOD PRODUCTS||||||||1 Pieces|All home made Ingredients||True||600799317P||||||||

While this snack is enjoyed for its taste and texture, it also offers some potential health benefits, such as: 1. High in protein: Chickpeas, the main ingredient in chana jor garam, are a good source of protein, with about 7-8 grams of protein per 1/2 cup serving. Protein is important for building and repairing tissues in the body and can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. , 2. Rich in fiber: Chickpeas are also a good source of fiber, with about 6-7 grams per 1/2 cup serving. Fiber can help promote digestive health, regulate blood sugar levels, and lower cholesterol levels. , 3. Low in fat: chana jor garam can be a low-fat snack. Roasted or air-fried versions can be a healthier alternative to deep-fried varieties. , 4.

Rich in fiber: Chickpeas are also a good source of fiber, with about 6-7 grams per 1/2 cup serving.

The Falhari Aloo Wafers or Falahari Aloo Wafer Namkeen snack offers a satisfying crunch and a burst of flavor. Each bite provides the delightful crispiness of the potato wafers, along with the savory notes from the seasoning, creating a tasty and enjoyable snacking experience.

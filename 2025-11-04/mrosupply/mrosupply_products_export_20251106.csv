Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are complex computers which automate control processes by using programs to communicate electronic signals to machines and devices. In simplified terms, they are usually comprised of three components:A CPU (Central Processing Unit), which is the brain or processor of the system, Inputs, and Outputs. An input module detects signals from things like switches, sensors, and buttons. This is processed by the CPU, which leads to an output relaying the CPUs instructions to a machine or device. PLC system functions can be expanded by adding extra I/O modules. These devices are widely used in modern industrial automation for controlling machinery, in industries such as packaging, food and beverage production, pharmaceutical, and printing.

The Allen Bradley SLC500 is a small chassis-based family of programmable controllers, discrete, analogue, and speciality I/O, and peripheral devices. The SLC500 family delivers power and flexibility with a wide range of communication configurations, features, and memory options. The smaller size of the SLC means that it can be used in applications which do not require the larger size and overhead of a traditional, full-size programmable logic controller. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are complex computers which automate control processes by using programs to communicate electronic signals to machines and devices. In simplified terms, they are usually comprised of three components:A CPU (Central Processing Unit), which is the brain or processor of the system, Inputs, and Outputs. An input module detects signals from things like switches, sensors, and buttons. This is processed by the CPU, which leads to an output relaying the CPUs instructions to a machine or device. PLC system functions can be expanded by adding extra I/O modules. PLC systems are widely used in modern industrial automation for controlling machinery, in industries such as packaging, food and beverage production, pharmaceutical, and printing.

These handy control units provide superior application coverage with improved network communications. What is a PLC? Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are complex computers which automate control processes by using programs to communicate electronic signals to machines and devices. In simplified terms, they are usually comprised of three components:A CPU (Central Processing Unit), which is the brain or processor of the system, Inputs, and Outputs. An input module detects signals from things like switches, sensors, and buttons. This is processed by the CPU, which leads to an output relaying the CPUs instructions to a machine or device. Logic Controller system functions can be expanded by adding extra I/O modules. These devices are widely used in modern industrial automation for controlling machinery, in industries such as packaging, food and beverage production, pharmaceutical, and printing.",294.00,,0.00 lbs / 0.00 kg,Automation >  Automation Surplus >  Controllers & PLCs >  PLC Accessories,https://www.mrosupply.com/automation/5716910_2080-serialisol_allen-bradley/,InStock,2080-SERIALISOL,,,2080-SERIALISOL

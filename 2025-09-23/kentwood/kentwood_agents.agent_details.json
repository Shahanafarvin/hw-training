After graduating from Colorado State University with degrees in Mathematics and Statistics, I decided to focus my attention to detail and my love for real estate into a lifelong career and dove in to being a full-time real estate agent in 2001.  Buying or selling a home is a huge investment and you need to know that your business is in the hands of an extremely capable agent. In 2008, after seven years of selling, I made the switch to Kentwood Real Estate to align myself with Colorado’s finest and most productive agents and have loved every minute of it since!\n\nThrough the years I have lived all over the state: Aurora, Denver, Durango, Fort Collins, Franktown, Greenwood Village, Morrison and Parker to name a few! This has really helped to expand my knowledge of the metro area, and help others to find the area of town that is the best fit for them. I also own several rental and investment properties throughout the state. I have kept my finger on the pulse of the rental market and am happy to help those looking to invest as well!\n\nDuring my non-working hours, I enjoy spending time doing photography, skiing, spending time with my friends and family, paying way too much attention to my dogs (Pickle and Jinx) and exploring all that Colorado has to offer! I have a daughter that is an ice hockey goalie for both Univeristy of Denver Jr Pioneers and SoCo Girl.\n\nTogether with Greg Yoshida and Zach Gilbert, we are The Move Group, Kentwood Real Estate!",

Martha Potter-Goldstein and Amy formed the Dwell Colorado Team and have been working together since 2007. Amy is a member of the Denver Board of Realtors and has a distinct commitment to service, results and professional ethics. Her incredible network includes many satisfied clients and an expansive network of brokers throughout Colorado, the U.S. and beyond. Her breadth of experience includes working with Denver Metro area sellers and buyers relocating into the city, suburbs and all along the front range, luxury home buyers, relocation in and out of Colorado, investor buyers, and first time home buyers too!\n \nThis profession never ceases to change and evolve with the economic and political environment of the world and it is challenging balancing the advances in technology and marketing with the personal side of real estate. Ultimately, what makes me successful is my commitment to excellent service, results and professional ethics. I have an incredible network with many satisfied clients and an expansive network of brokers throughout Colorado, the U.S. and beyond.\n \nI earned a B.F.A from at the University of Kansas in 2000 and promptly moved to Denver to start my new life. Shortly after I earned my real estate license and have never looked back!\"\n \nWorking with Sellers & Buyers\n \nSelling a home in today’s market can be challenging. It will take more than sticking a sign in your yard. You need an agent with a plan. Amy & Martha will use both traditional and cutting-edge marketing to find you a buyer. This includes open houses, neighborhood newspapers, postcards, flyers/e-flyers, etc. Your property will be advertised through a multitude of real estate and social media sites. A professional photo shoot, full-color brochures, and a staging consult are included with every listing. There are no short cuts when Amy and Martha list your home.\n \nLikewise, when you’re buying a property in the Denver Metro area, you should work with an agent that knows the neighborhoods. You will need answers to some important questions regarding: schools, zoning, traffic, bus stops…Some neighborhoods are great for families, while others are better suited for young singles. It is important that you find an agent that knows what you’re looking for and knows the areas.\n \nWhether you’re a buyer or a seller, you will find Amy & Martha to be honest, hardworking, and knowledgeable agents. Amy's personal goal is to bring a fresh perspective to an old industry.",

  "description": "As an avid horsewoman myself, I know you aren't just looking for any property. You need the right property – a property with the resources and space to enjoy your animals and let your passion flourish. \n\nOriginally from Michigan, I have lived and sold real estate all over the United States. A job opportunity brought my family to Colorado but the mild winters, mountains, and open space have kept us here. \n\nAfter years of working in sales and management, I came back to my first love of real estate and horse properties. I’m now a certified BHHS Luxury Home Specialist and was ranked in the top 10% of agents in the country last year. I’ve helped my clients find the space and facilities to let their hobbies run, and make their particular real estate goals their real estate realities.\n\nI specialize in land and horse properties but if that’s not what you’re looking for, I have the skills and acuity to help you find the right-sized space for your needs. I am a keen listener, a great negotiator, and I have the connections to find the right place for you. Helping a first-time home buyer find their first home is just as thrilling and satisfying for me!\n\nWhen I am not helping my clients find their dream properties, I’m enjoying my own animals. I am a lifelong equestrian with two horses at home – a thoroughbred that I compete with and a mini that is learning to drive. Our small ranch also includes two Cattle Dogs and our kitty cat, Zoey. My husband Mark and I have one daughter who is a music instructor, songwriter, and performer. \n\nI serve on the board of the Northern Colorado Dressage Association and I’m also a Committee Member of Profit from Experience – a part of the Partnership for Age-Friendly Communities in Larimer County, working to ensure that all people have equal access to jobs and resources in our community, no matter their age. I write a monthly real estate article for the organization’s newsletter and am a resource for market updates.\n\nHorse and acreage properties, and finding the right home, can be challenging. Whether buying or selling, working with a seasoned agent will make all the difference. I am passionate about finding the right place for you and your animals and I have the experience to make it happen. \n\nAndreaNoCoProperties.com.",

  "description": "Andrea sees her job as helping to fulfill dreams. “All the long hours are worth it when I find a family their perfect home. Maybe it has a kitchen window that faces the backyard so the parents can watch the children play while cooking. Or it could be finding an oasis on the Poudre River that my Buyers never knew existed.” A home, after all, can be in the lives of a family for potentially generations to come.\n\nThe key to Andrea’s success is listening to her clients closely and hearing what details are important to them. She constantly asks questions and never gives up. “I will write offers others may not think are realistic. I will go the extra mile to find out an answer and very often my clients end up with properties they may not have ever considered possible.”\n\nAndrea loves helping all Clients however she has a special place in her heart for First Time Home Buyers, those Relocating to the Northern Colorado area, New Construction and Investment Properties. As you work with Andrea, you will notice her strong core values of communication, connection, confidence, compassion and care for you.\n\nCommunity involvement is a way of life for Andrea. She is an active member of Harvest Church, serving on the worship team. And last but definitely not least, a proud aunt to an adorable niece and nephews. You will find Andrea enjoying dancing, biking, arts & crafts, music, traveling and outdoor adventures.",

  "description": "I was born in the picturesque landscapes of California and spent my childhood in the idyllic setting of Colorado's western slope, specifically Grand Junction, until 1986 when I embarked on my journey as a Denver resident. My passion for real estate has been a constant thread in my life, starting in 1994 when I earned my Colorado Realtor® license, and it continues to thrive as I proudly serve as an Associate with Kentwood Real Estate City Properties, a journey that began in September 2000. I am a current member of the Denver Metro Association of Realtors®, the Colorado Association of Realtors® and the National Association of Realtors®.\n\nMy introduction to Denver real estate was through various roles in administration, systems, marketing, technology, and training. These early experiences prepared me with a deep understanding of the industry's inner workings, which has proven invaluable in my career. With more than three decades of calling Denver home, I have cultivated an intimate knowledge of Downtown, and surrounding Denver urban neighborhoods.\n\nMy professional arsenal includes a rich blend of marketing prowess, exceptional sales acumen, and a comprehensive grasp of technology. I am equally adept at working with both buyers and sellers, seamlessly guiding them through the entire real estate process, from its inception to a successful conclusion. From our first conversation to long after closing, my goal is for you to never feel confused or alone because I can ensure you are in great care from day one.\n\nMy unwavering commitment to precision, honed negotiation skills, and a strong dedication to communication have consistently earned me a devoted clientele, who often become my most vocal advocates, spreading word-of-mouth recommendations. \n\nBeyond my real estate pursuits, my life is enriched by a diverse range of hobbies. I am deeply passionate about volunteer work, finding fulfillment in giving back to my community. Additionally, I am a culinary enthusiast, an avid traveler, a cinephile, a dedicated yogi, and a passionate host when it comes to entertaining friends and family. These interests, like the facets of my career, collectively contribute to the rich tapestry of experiences that define who I am. \n\nFor more information on my real estate services, phone 303-489-1197, or contact me via email at andrew@kentwood.com.",

  "description": "After leaving the Governor’s Office in January of 2007, Bob Lee went back to the private sector doing that which he began 20 years earlier…brokering real estate transactions. Joining his wife Nancy at Kentwood Real Estate allowed Bob to again be part of one of the metro Denver areas most dynamic real estate teams. Since 1987 the Lee Team has helped friends and clients buy and sell over 1,100 homes.\n\nIn March of 2004, Bob Lee was appointed Secretary of the Cabinet and Chief of Staff to Governor Bill Owens. During the ensuing 3 years he functioned as the chief operating officer for the State of Colorado. He was responsible for developing and leading a talented team of budget and policy advisors and for managing the State’s senior executives. As the Governor’s principal advisor, Lee was charged with implementing policy and working to achieve consensus between the Executive Branch and the Legislature on major pieces of legislation.\n\nPrior to that appointment, Lee served as Director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade; a post that he held since July 2000. In that position he served as a member of the Governor’s Cabinet and oversaw a wide range of economic development activities, which included domestic and international business development, small business programs, as well as the Colorado Tourism Office, the Motion Picture and Television Commission and the Colorado Economic Development Commission. Lee served as a member of the Governor’s Commission on Science and Technology, and as the Governor’s designee on the Colorado Economic Development Commission and the Governor’s Financial Review Committee. Additionally, he chaired the Motion Picture and Television Commission Advisory Board and was a member of the World Trade Center Board of Directors and the Economic Developers’ Council of Colorado.\n\nPrior to joining the Owens’ Administration, Lee was an active member of the Denver real estate community. In 1995, he became part owner of RE/MAX Classic, an office which grew to 65 agents and was ranked among the metro area’s top producing firms.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Lee served as campaign manager for a number of Colorado political candidates. Among them was Apollo 13 astronaut, Jack Swigert, who went on to win election in Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District. In 1983, Lee received a White House appointment in the Reagan Administration and served as one of two Deputy Directors in the Region VIII office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Following a three-year stint at HHS, he entered the world of investment real estate where, as a partner and Managing Director of RMI Capital Management, his company invested almost $250 million on behalf of pension clients in the western United States.\n\nLee is an active community leader. In 2016, Governor Hickenlooper appointed him to a fourth term on the Board of Directors of the Denver Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District.  Lee formerly served as Vice Chairman of the Governor's Drug Control and System Improvement Board. He is a past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce. He is a graduate of Regis University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration.",

  "description": "Brent Gilles understands the difference between finding clients a house and finding them a home. The fundamental distinction, he believes, is that while there may be lots of houses to consider in a given market, only a handful may truly satisfy the needs and desires of his client. For Brent, his reputation as a highly respected realtor is less about location, location, location, and more about experience, experience, experience. His 28 years spent working in real estate enables him to think outside the box, structuring deals and transactions that help his clients feel great about their experience and know they have made a solid decision. Whether he is showing someone 5 homes or 50, Brent brings enthusiasm and passion to every client. \n\nBrent prides himself on working diligently to make sure everyone -- family, friend, client or even someone he’s just met -- is made to feel important. Putting others first, he believes, brings happiness and success to all, a key factor that brings him a steady base of referrals and repeat clients. He has experienced a wide spectrum of market conditions during his 28 years as a residential broker and imparts that vast knowledge to his clients. Brent’s enthusiasm for his profession stems from the belief that every day is different, and every transaction is unique, beginning with a client’s wants, needs and ultimately their goals. He uses his strong knowledge of current market conditions to successfully navigate transactions in a professional and thoughtful manner. \n\nA Colorado native, Brent is well-versed in the unique neighborhoods that are part and parcel of the Denver metro area. His familiarity with Denver and surrounding suburbs helps him match clients with areas that best suit their needs, and he works tirelessly to help them find the perfect home that will serve them now and in the future. His clients appreciate his candor, and he will not hesitate to point out aspects of a home they may not recognize, discussing pros and cons to ensure they have as much information as possible. “I’m a real people person and I take the time to listen and understand what is best for my client,” Brent says. “My goal is for every client to understand how we can together successfully meet their expectations. My clients value my honesty and know I will never encourage them to consider a property that is not aligned with their wants, needs and goals.” \n\nAn avid skier, Brent clicked into his first pair of skis at age three and could not get enough of the sport and gratitude for the surroundings.  Eventually the passion for skiing and particularly moguls led to competing for the Winter Park Freestyle Ski Team.  He also enjoys golf, tennis, volleyball, pickleball and loves to take advantage of Colorado’s endless outdoor activities!",

  "description": "What do you value in a real estate professional?  Market knowledge?  Industry knowledge?  Negotiation skills?  Zealous, yet ethical representation of you and your needs?\n\nReal estate transactions are often the most significant financial endeavors in our lives, and they are becoming much more complicated with high risks leading to great rewards.  You deserve to have a seasoned, highly trained real estate adviser representing your interests.  With my broad and diverse background in real estate practice and transactions, know that your goals are my duties.  While I work within a diverse portfolio of real estate sectors, my specialties are luxury sales and relocation of healthcare executives and physicians.\n\nReal estate and community are two passions I learned from my late mother, who taught our family that investing in housing could create financial and mental security where there had been none.\n\nBeing a native of Boulder, Colorado provides me with a valuable depth of knowledge about the real estate market in this special and unique portion of the state. Clients appreciate that I quickly distill their needs and desires into a bespoke solution. Years living and working in the Boulder area provide expertise that extends from the broad array of communities and neighborhoods in the Boulder Valley, to an understanding of construction techniques, to an ability to analyze current market information and strength in negotiating complex transactions.\n\nIt’s been my pleasure and privilege to have worked in international markets and with global clientele along with my many years as a Boulder Valley real estate specialist. This experience provides a unique perspective on the importance of home ownership and community involvement. I find that I am naturally inquisitive and love to share my hometown with newcomers, relocating families, and first-time buyers. My deep experience in the luxury market parlays into a love of helping those new to the area gain their footing as locals.\n\nBeing a “local” for me extends to my love of the magical outdoors that are the essence of Colorado – fly fishing, mountaineering, cycling, hiking, skiing, and exploring with my amazing Lab/Weimaraner “Sebastian.” I enjoy exploring the best restaurants and entertainment in the area, and sharing that knowledge with my clients. My affiliation with Kentwood Real Estate combines my fondness for a local brand that has a strong market presence throughout Colorado’s Front Range. My perspective is that Kentwood has an incredibly deep and solid reputation in both the real estate community and the buyer/seller/homeowner community.\n\nMembership in Luxury Portfolio International, Who’s Who in Luxury Real Estate, and Leading Real Estate Companies of the World has provided additional support for marketing my properties nationally and globally, and to gain broader market knowledge and understanding. These affiliations provide access to the best real estate professionals around the world.\n\nCommitted to improving the profession, I have spent many years in leadership roles.  I served as 2023 Chairman of BOLO REALTORS, the Boulder Valley’s REALTOR association, and am a member of the 2024 BOLO Leadership team. As a BOLO board member, my goal is to raise the bar of professionalism for members, which in turn benefits consumers.  I am past Chairman of the Boulder Area REALTOR Association and have received multiple awards as a 5-Star Real Estate Professional and top producer. As a Certified Negotiation Expert and a Ninja Selling coach and trainer I strive to improve the professionalism of my colleagues. My desire to help our communities extends to my charitable giving. I donate a portion of my commissions to Food Bank of the Rockies; and to World Bicycle Relief, which provides cargo bicycles and mechanical support to remote villages in Africa.",

  "description": "With a diverse professional background and a passion for helping others, Brian Devlin brings a unique and well-rounded perspective to the world of real estate. Holding a degree in Philosophy, Brian has developed a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication—skills that seamlessly translate into his real estate practice.\n\nBefore entering the real estate industry, Brian built a successful career in both retail management and home medical operations and logistics management. These roles honed his ability to identify market trends, maintain financial responsibility, and lead large teams with integrity. His experience managing complex logistics and client relationships gives him a distinct edge in navigating the fast-paced, detail-oriented nature of real estate transactions.\n\nOriginally rooted in the Thornton and Erie areas of Colorado, Brian’s success in business led to multiple transfers across several states, including Minnesota, California, and Florida where he was entrusted with ‘righting the ship’ and instilling quality business practices; an experience that deepened his understanding of diverse markets and strengthened his adaptability. This diverse experience has given Brian a deep appreciation for the unique Colorado lifestyle. Now that he has returned to Colorado, Brian is able to use his broad perspective of different communities alongside his local knowledge and professional insight to help clients find the perfect fit for their needs, whether buying, selling, or investing.\n\nOutside of real estate, Brian cherishes his role as a husband and father. He enjoys exploring new destinations with his family and actively supports his young daughters in their academic and extracurricular activities.\n\nWhether you’re looking to buy your first home or expand your real estate portfolio, Brian Devlin is ready to guide you every step of the way with transparency, dedication, and a personalized approach.",

  "description": "A Cornhusker through and through, this proud Nebraska native is a bit of a renaissance man. Prior to getting his real estate license in 2017, Brian worked in education, the non-profit sector and talent management. In 2016, he founded one of the country’s hottest ice cream concepts, Chaos & Cream, which was profiled on the Food Network. His meticulous attention to detail and insatiable need to please clients have helped him succeed at every stage of life and, based on the results he has already produced in real estate, clearly those skills have carried over.\n\nBrian chose real estate because he wanted the opportunity to thoroughly and thoughtfully work with people during one of the most important periods of their life. Whether a client is purchasing a home, selling one or making an investment, it’s vital he or she has confidence in Brian and feels at ease with the process.\n\nAs for why he selected Kentwood Real Estate as his real estate home? “I want to be one of the best at everything I do, so I chose to work with the best in the business. Kentwood’s reputation is light years ahead, and each and every one of our brokers is dedicated to the highest standard of excellence and ethics.” Like any good officially recognized REALTOR®, Brian appreciates the importance of relationship building and networking. He also enjoys the role technology and social media play in today’s real estate marketing landscape.\n\nBrian loves living in the Washington Park neighborhood with his two sons and the family dog, Barkley. On any given spring, summer or fall evening, Brian and his boys can be found at Red Rocks or Coors Field. Jakob (20) and Sam (16) are also entrepreneurs as they both own their own businesses. They have always been encouraged not only to dream, but to realize those dreams and bring them to fruition.\n\nBrian has coached several of his boys' sports teams, supported and volunteered for a number of organizations including Boys and Girls Clubs and Jewish Family Service and served on the boards of Adoption Options and the Denver School of Science and Technology as well as PTAs at the elementary, middle and high school levels. \n\nIn addition to live music and sporting events, Brian's interests include cooking, hiking, nutrition, skiing, traveling and yoga.\n\nFind Brian on Facebook and Instagram: @BrianRosenKentwood.\n\nBrian Rosen\nDirect: (303) 408-1781\nbrosen@kentwood.com\nwww.dwellcolorado.com",

  "description": "Charlotte lives by the mantra that first impressions are everything. Before getting her real estate license, Charlotte honed her design eye as a buyer in women’s contemporary and designer clothing. She built a loyal clientele with her strong sense of fashion and the desire to make everyone look and feel like the best version of themselves. Since relocating to Denver, she helped numerous clients transform their wardrobes and closets. She has translated that love of aesthetics to real estate. She is able to see potential in almost every home she enters whether it’s a fixer upper or a new build that needs your personal stamp. She loves staging homes by bringing in furniture, art, and accessories to ensure your home feels unique, modern, and stylish. She uses her past experience in some of the best closets in Denver to help edit and organize your home before you list. Small details matter, and she wants your home to shine the minute it hits the market.\n\nCharlotte attended Tulane University in New Orleans where her love of historic architecture and design was cemented. She has a particular affinity for homes with a bit of a past. Her clients value her attention to detail and no-nonsense east coast sensibility. She will always tell you what you need to hear rather than what you want to hear. The process of buying a home (whether it’s your first or last) can be confusing and stressful, and she aims to walk you through every step of the way with a little bit of humor thrown in for good measure.\n\nCharlotte jokes that she is probably the least Colorado person in all of Denver. She has never skied in her life and has zero desire to ever hike a 14-er. She will work 24-7 if you let her, but when she takes that rare time off, she loves playing tennis, entertaining friends with a fabulous dinner party, and cheering for all the Washington, DC sports teams even when they’re terrible.",

  "description": "As a seasoned entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in building and scaling businesses across a variety of industries, I bring a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective to the real estate world. Having successfully founded, grown, and exited several businesses, I understand the value of strategic planning, negotiation, and delivering results—skills that are crucial in helping clients achieve their real estate goals. \n\nMy journey into real estate has been shaped by my background in business development, financial management, and operations. I started my career by launching an environmental health and safety consulting business that was successfully exited after 12 years of continuous growth. This was followed by launching a service-based business that was developed from the ground up, growing it into a multi-location operation with over 70 employees. After years of driving its growth and overseeing every aspect of the business, I successfully facilitated its acquisition, marking a significant milestone in my career. These experiences taught me the importance of understanding both the big picture and the fine details—qualities that I now apply to every real estate transaction. \n\nWhether it’s assisting first-time homebuyers, investors, or those looking to sell, I leverage my strong negotiation skills, financial expertise, and deep understanding of market dynamics to guide clients through the process. My ability to build relationships and create value through strategic partnerships has proven invaluable in the real estate market, where every deal is an opportunity to create lasting connections and deliver exceptional results. \n\nIn addition to my business acumen, I have extensive experience in risk management and regulatory compliance. This ensures that every transaction I manage is smooth, transparent, and legally sound, giving my clients peace of mind. I’m also committed to providing a personalized experience—listening to my clients’ needs, understanding their goals, and offering guidance at every step of the way. \n\nBeyond my professional life, I’ve been deeply involved in my community. As president of the Spartans Youth Club, I’ve led organizational growth and mentored young athletes. I’ve also spent years coaching youth football, focusing on skill development, teamwork, and leadership. These experiences have shaped my approach to real estate, where I emphasize collaboration and open communication, ensuring that my clients feel supported throughout the process. \n\nWhen I’m not helping clients find their dream properties, you can find me enjoying the outdoors, whether it’s golfing, snowboarding, or scuba diving. Traveling is another passion of mine, as it gives me the opportunity to learn and explore new perspectives. \n\nWhether you're buying, selling, or simply exploring your real estate options, I’m here to provide the expertise, commitment, and personalized service you deserve. Let’s work together to make your real estate goals a reality!",

I can remember as a child wandering through the iconic campus designed by one of my favorite architects, Meis van de Rohe! I developed, at an early age, a special appreciation for the buildings and those that created the amazing architecture that surrounded me!\n\nI studied ballet from the age of 4 which led me to study dance at Butler University (Indianapolis), Mills College (Oakland), Cornish College of Arts (Seattle) and then on to New York City to study with and perform with numerous dance companies, most notably \"The Dance Theater of Harlem.\" I currently enjoy being a member of the board of a fabulous local theater company, \"The Catamounts.\"\n\nTravel has been a constant during my lifetime, and I have been fortunate to visit many countries and several continents including a year of study in West Africa and several months in Southeast Asia!\n\nIn 1992 I moved to Boulder from the NYC area with my family including two young children in tow. Bear Creek Elementary, Southern Hills Middle School, Horizons Middle School, Fairview High School, New Vista High School, CSU, and CU. I am so proud to have raised my children here in the beautiful city of Boulder.\n\nI started my Real Estate Career in Boulder in 1993 and have since been privileged to successfully help hundreds of clients obtain the home of their dreams or realize the most gain on their home investments. I am honored by the loyalty and friendship of so many clients over the years!\n\nYear after year, I have earned the Berkshire Hathaway President’s Circle Award given to those who are in the top producing 3% of Agents. In 2021 I was honored to receive the Berkshire Hathaway Chairman’s Gold Award given to those who are in the top producing 2% of Agents and most recently, I was honored to receive the Berkshire Hathaway Chairman’s Platinum Award given to those who are in the top producing 1% of Agents.\n\nAnd now here I am, grandmother of three darling children and still going strong. I adore my profession as a realtor and continue to learn and to expand on my expertise.\n\nAs a proud member of Kentwood Real Estate Boulder Valley, I am extremely excited to offer my services to you in order for you to realize your Real Estate dreams!",

A fourteen-year resident of Downtown Denver, my knowledge of the Downtown Denver real estate market and my enthusiasm for the city's offerings are unmatched. Whether it is the redevelopment of Union Station, rezoning in LoHi, or a new restaurant in LoDo, nothing gets past me. This intimate knowledge of Downtown Denver and the adjacent city-close neighborhoods is why sellers and buyers seek me out for their real estate needs.\n\nNEW PROJECTS EXPERT\nI was one of the first residents of the vibrant Riverfront Park neighborhood, the award-winning multi-use development along Commons Park below Union Station. There, I worked for the neighborhood developer, East West Partners, selling real estate in one of Denver's most sought after neighborhoods. After my first year in sales, I was awarded the Silver Rookie of the Year Award by the Colorado Home Builders Association. Since that time, I have succeed as a top producer in Riverfront Park, participating in over Five Hundred Million in new development sales from 2000 to 2010.\n\nEXPERIENCE & EXPERTISE\nIn 2011, I expanded my scope to include all Central Denver neighborhoods, becoming one of Denver's top producers, participating in approximately Fifty million in real estate sales.\n\nLIVING THE LIFESTYLE\nOriginally from Houston, Texas, I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Houston where I graduated magna cum laude. I moved to Colorado in 1991, where I lived and worked in the luxury mountain community of the Vail Valley. My professional accomplishments include ownership of my own health and fitness business, producer of a nationally syndicated television series, on-air television personality, and status as a top producing, 14-year broker in Downtown Denver real estate. I am active with several charitable and cultural organizations including the Denver Art Museum, Project Angel Heart, the Denver Rescue Mission, CultureHaus, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. When I'm not selling real estate, I enjoys skiing, theatre, music, and the arts- and of course, living and working in Downtown Denver.",

  "description": "After spending her formative years between Milwaukee and France, Elizabeth headed west to attend Colorado College.  She immediately fell in love with Colorado’s abundant opportunities for outdoor adventure.  Elizabeth began her career in real estate in 2009 and was thrilled to join Kentwood Real Estate in 2011.  She cites Kentwood’s strong reputation, ethics and culture of collaboration as just some of the reasons she chose to be a Kentwood broker.   \n\nBetween 2012-2020, Elizabeth and her team won 5280 Magazine’s Five-Star Real Estate agent award every year, consistently ranking among Kentwood Cherry Creek’s top 3 producers in both volume and number of transactions closed.  Elizabeth has received multiple certifications as a Realtor, including as a Pricing Strategy Advisor.  In 2021, Elizabeth partnered with Libby Levinson to create Vesta Homes at Kentwood Real Estate, with the shared vision of offering clients a level of service, experience and market knowledge rarely combined in the real estate industry.\n\nWhether a client is purchasing their dream home or an investment, downsizing or expanding, Elizabeth is an expert strategist, trusted advocate and seasoned negotiator.  Drawing on a diverse background in fundraising and academia, Elizabeth excels at managing the process of purchasing and selling property so that her clients are aware of every opportunity available.  She works tirelessly to ensure her clients realize the greatest return and satisfaction from their experience.  Elizabeth breaks the transaction down into clear steps, explaining each process, so her clients are knowledgeable and empowered about their decisions throughout the contract.  She maintains strong relationships with her clients, checking in and consulting as they consider improvements or next steps.\n\nIn her own words, “I focus on the potential my clients have to maximize their home appreciation and am always examining properties to ensure their growth over time.  Having seen the highs and lows of various real estate markets, I work to protect my clients’ long term real estate interests.  Finding value and opportunity in housing is what drives me.  I’m proud to say that 100% of my clients are referrals from past clients, and I often work with multiple generations of families.”  Having painstakingly remodeled an 1895 Victorian home, she provides her clients thoughtful insights into profitable upgrades and the nuances of the inspection process.  Her expertise spans the Denver metropolitan area and its wide range of neighborhoods, price points, and school districts.  \n\nWhen not working, Elizabeth spends time with her husband and two daughters enjoying Colorado’s rivers and mountains, voraciously reading her next book club selection, or traveling the globe- from Antarctica to Zanzibar.",

Born and raised in Congress Park, she’s a proud graduate of East High School and now calls Harvey Park home. Aside from a five-year adventure in Oregon, where she earned a degree in Art History from the University of Oregon, Fielding has always been rooted in the Mile High City.\n\nHer lifelong connection to Denver gives her an unmatched insider’s perspective on the city’s neighborhoods, from beloved local staples to up-and-coming hotspots and hidden gems only a true local would know. She also comes from a real estate legacy: her mother, Aimee Twarogowski, is a longtime Denver Realtor, giving Fielding both a personal and professional foundation in the business. With deep roots and a pulse on Denver’s ever-evolving housing market, she offers clients a strategic edge when it comes to buying or selling.\n\nCombining her love for art, architecture, and interior design with her deep market knowledge, Fielding brings a creative eye and thoughtful approach to every transaction. She has a unique ability to see the beauty and potential in every property, whether it shines from the curb or reveals itself slowly.\n\nWhen she’s not helping clients find their perfect place in Denver and the surrounding areas, you’ll likely find Fielding spending time with her partner and two daughters, knitting something cozy, thrifting for vintage treasures, gardening, or diving into her latest home project. She and her family live in a mid-century modern Cliff May home, where she continues to enjoy the charm of Denver living and the strong sense of community she’s always cherished.\n\nWhether you’re new to Denver or a longtime local, Fielding is ready to help you find a home that feels just right.",

This commitment to providing first-class service, integrity and innovation next led Foodie to Kentwood. “I wanted to be part of something special.” They understand the secret to building long term relationships is earning the trust, respect and loyalty of every single client. \n\nHaving lived in Southern California, traveled extensively in France and holding an active license in the Greater Las Vegas Area, Foodie points to the importance of local, national and international collaboration to bring buyers and sellers together.\n\nFoodie has made a point of mentoring and training new sales and broker associates at every stage of his and their careers. What advice does he dispense? “Be optimistic, brave, have faith and always strive to be better tomorrow than you are today. And invest in real estate!” \n\nHe passionately supports charities addressing the significant needs of domestic animals. A ski bum through and through, he is proud to be both a skier and snowboarder. “If it involves a ski lift and goggles, I’m there. Having the mountains and lakes in our backyards never gets old.” \n\nFoodie’s colleagues call him a caring, generous, hard-working guy, something he credits his parents with instilling in him. “They showed me not to take shortcuts, to lead by example and to always treat others the way I wanted to be treated.”",

  "description": "The ultimate Denverite, Greg grew up in Glenmoor, attended St Mary's and Kent Denver and learned to play golf at Cherry Hills. His father instilled in him at an early age that hard work, reliability, and communication are key to achieving the goals you set in life and business. “My dad is the most focused, honorable and caring person I know. He taught me that we learn more from our struggles than from our successes and that I always have to be raising the bar for what clients should expect from me.”\n\nGreg left the nest to study Theater and the Entertainment Industry at Rollins College in Winter Park, FL, and then worked on numerous international projects, commercials, and Netflix productions. Having scratched the show biz itch Greg was drawn to real estate and in 2016 began his 2nd career as an agent in West Palm Beach, Fl. He set out to deliver relaxed and enjoyable experiences for his clients. Even with business booming, he could feel the mountains calling and returned home, immediately drawn to the brand he grew up seeing in the city’s nicest neighborhoods.\n\n “I knew about Kentwood’s incredible reputation as the best place to build a wonderful career in Colorado. The brokers are impeccable and set the standard for expertise and ethical business practices.” Between his insight into the nuances of different communities and the resources Kentwood provides him, the results have been undeniable. He also enjoys working with FHA and VA buyers. “Those transactions can be tricky but it’s so fulfilling helping a buyer accomplish more than they ever imagined.”\n\nGreg also loves getting to share his favorite spots with relocation clients. A perfect Saturday starts with helping a client close on their dream home and then heading over to City Park to explore the Denver Zoo, Science Museum or IMAX theater, followed by a nutritious lunch at Mustard's Last Stand and Bonnie Brae Ice Cream. “I only indulge a couple of times a year, so I live vicariously through my clients, many of whom become friends.” Greg is passionate about the Denver Dumb Friend's League and Habitat for Humanity. Whenever he can, he escapes to the mountains for fly fishing, hiking, skiing and nature photography.",

As a seller I will customize a marketing plan that will sell your homes as quickly and as smoothly as possible.\n\nI approach each transaction uniquely.

If you are a Real Estate Investor I can find your rental properties, commercial tenants or help in the purchase and sale of “fix and sell” properties.\n\nBorn and raised in the Denver area, Greg went to Cherry Creek High School and was an International Affairs/Japanese Major from the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Greg also received a Degree from the California Culinary Academy (Culinary Arts/ Hospitality Management).

  "description": "When we think of classic, we think of nature's beauty, the time-tested, a model of excellence. We think of memorable sunsets, a bouquet of roses, the finest cars, beautiful homes. Things that make us feel good about life and all it has to offer.\n\nJ. Garland Thurman understands. He maintains a classic approach to work and play founded in a strong commitment to the values of family life. He grew up in a small town in the Ozark Mountains (population 500) where his family owned a farm. Garland has fond memories of milking cows after school and taking care of all kinds of livestock including Hereford cattle, horses, chickens and hogs. To this day, he retains a small town charm from an upbringing that taught him to treat others with respect and honesty.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Missouri with a degree in marketing, he was offered a position with a large oil firm. Soon he was promoted and transferred to Denver to handle the company's real estate concerns. This position opened up new horizons to Garland, and he saw how his talents and expertise were perfectly suited to creating real estate solutions.\n\nHe also experienced firsthand the challenges that accompany a job transfer. Garland is one of Denver's foremost experts in corporate relocation who has developed a plan that benefits the employer and helps make the transition for the employee and his or her family as comfortable as possible. \"Whether it's a corporate relocation or a local resident who wants to buy or sell a home, I guide them in the analysis of what home or sales strategy best suits their needs,\" says Garland. \"My greatest professional reward comes from helping families achieve their real estate goals.\" When you talk with Garland, you find that he really cares about people and is committed to being the best in his profession. This is evident from his classic approach to real estate. Very few agents have achieved his level of production or caliber of service. As you talk with him, you're overcome by his enthusiasm and calmed by his knowledge.\n\nGarland is a no-nonsense, straight-forward businessman who understands the good old-fashioned values of customer service. Most importantly, he knows real estate is a people business, that the bottom line is your satisfaction. Buying or selling a home is often the largest transaction most of us will make in our lifetime. That's why Garland strives to keep your transaction simple and worry free. \"My number one priority is to provide exceptional service,\" he says. \"I think the real estate process should be an enjoyable experience.\" Call Garland today and experience his classic approach to real estate... because your family deserves it.\n\nFor the Denver Real Estate News Blog, go to GarlandThurman.com.",

Besides a few years in Oregon working in retail management and as a non-profit Grant Writer and Communications Manager, she has spent her entire life here in the mountains.\n\nJaden points to her focus on relationship building as the foundation for her success. She reminisces about attending open houses and meeting new clients with her dad. “His sincerity and empathy in helping clients make such an intimidating financial decision inspired me. That’s why I specialize in working with first-time home buyers now. I strive to be the approachable Realtor® who meets clients where they’re at. I want them to know no matter where in the process they are, no matter what their price range, no matter the depth of their experience with real estate, I am there for them.”\n\nHaving earned her Realtor® designation, Jaden is also a proud member of the Denver Metro Association of REALTORS®. “It is a great organization that keeps me current in all aspects of the business.”\n\nA former staff member and current volunteer, she is deeply committed to the mission of the CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) organization, working with children in the foster care system, identifying gaps in care and advocating on their behalf in court. She’s also passionate about mental health and social justice advocacy.\n\nJaden’s nine-pound dog, Bear, is the Combs Sell Homes’ team mascot. She has a dark green thumb (Kentwood green of course) and she’s using the other nine fingers to bang out her first novel, usually roosting at St. Mark’s Coffee House. The way to her heart starts and ends with their chocolate chip cookies.",

  "description": "There are so many great places to live in Northern Colorado!  Whether you're buying or selling, I'm here to guide you through the process.  If you're selling, let's discuss how to showcase your home for the best possible price. If you're buying, let's explore your lifestyle & needs and find the perfect home to match.  I'll be with you every step of the way, through all the steps of the journey. \n\nWith over a decade of experience, I've helped countless clients achieve their real estate goals. I offer expert guidance, strong negotiation skills, and deep market knowledge to every buying, selling, or investment transaction. My commitment to exceptional service extends far beyond closing—I'm always just a call, text, or email away.\n\nIf you're interested in new construction, that is one of my specialties. In 2014 I worked to obtain a Certified New Home Specialist (CNHS) designation. I am well equipped to guide you through the new home process, whether you are interested in a community developed by one of the big guys (DR Horton, Century, Toll Brothers, etc) or in a completely custom home built by a Northern Colorado builder.\n\nI am honored to serve as President-Elect of the Fort Collins Board of Realtors and as a member of the NoCo HBA. I am passionate about advocating for our industry and championing the rights of homeownership. One of the greatest aspects of being a Realtor is the incredible support and continuous educational opportunities offered by our local, state, and national organizations. In our ever-changing field, continuous learning is essential for success. \n\nThanks for dropping by my page and I look forward to hearing from you.    \n\n5 things about me:\n\nFavorite Colorado outdoor activity:  Do I have to pick just one?  Ok, road biking… no wait, paddleboarding… no wait, hiking.\n\nFavorite place to travel:  Just about any beach location or Italy.\n\nFavorite sports team:  KC Chiefs, don’t judge… I lived there for 10 years in the 90’s during the Schottenheimer heyday.\n\nPast Life:  I ran away with the circus (as the Lighting Director, not the bearded lady) and was a lighting designer & electrician for hundreds of shows and events across the country.\n\nFavorite place to volunteer:  Meals on Wheels.",

  "description": "Jim Nussbaum was born and raised in Appleton, Wisconsin, receiving his Bachelor of Arts Degree (B.A.) in English from Saint John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, with highest honors, and his Masters Degree in Business Administration/Marketing (M.B.A.) from the University of Wisconsin. He was the first person in his family to attend and graduate from college.\n\nJim began his sales career at the age of 17, selling vacuum cleaners door to door. He paid 100% of his way through seven years of college by selling cookware, china, flatware and cutlery for The Vita Craft Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri. Starting as a salesman, Jim was promoted to District Manager for Vita Craft. After receiving his M.B.A., Jim joined the General Electric Company (G.E.) in Corporate Planning and Market Research as a consultant, working with the company in Syracuse, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois. In Washington D.C. and New York City, he then joined G. E.'s educational affiliate, The General Learning Corporation, where he functioned as a Corporate Planner and a Regional Marketing Director in charge of selling educational programs to such firms as IBM.\n\nAfter his employment with The General Learning Corporation, Jim joined American Salesmasters, Inc., a firm specializing in selling sales training and motivational programs throughout the country to salespeople in every sales field. He conducted hundreds of motivational sales meetings before sales groups in New York City, New York, and Colorado Springs, Colorado. While in the Springs, Jim's sales production earned him the designation of number two salesperson among 65 Salesmasters salespeople throughout the country. Jim has conducted many real estate and motivational seminars and has been on the same program with such self-help notables as the late Earl Nightingale and Dr.Norman Vincent Peale.\n\nJim began his residential real estate sales career as a real estate salesman with a local Denver company, Van Schaack and Co. He made the President’s Club each year, and in five of his last seven years with that firm was its top residential salesperson out of over 350 sales associates. After his eleven- year sales career with Van Schaack, Jim left the company and formed a new real estate company, The Kentwood Co., with four other Van Schaack salespeople. In 2007 the five partners sold the company to two individuals who a few years later sold the company to HomeServices of America, Inc.\n\nJim’s closed sales volume has been consistently high, and in several years he was recognized as the number ONE residential salesperson in the State of Colorado. In his 50+ year residential sales career, still on-going, he has participated in over 2800 closings with a closed sales volume in excess of $1.3 Billion. His real estate designations include GRI, CRS, SRES, CIPS, and CDPE. He received several real estate awards from the Denver Sales and Marketing Executives Club, as well as in-person awards from sales motivational icons the late Og Mandino and Earl Nightingale. He has been listed in Who’s Who in America.\n\nAfter selling The Kentwood Company, Jim has remained with his firm in a non-ownership, sales capacity, and continues to actively sell residential real estate with his three-person team, The Kruse-Nussbaum Team. He recently wrote and published a book entitled “Significance: A Lifetime of Learning, Earning and Love”, which is available at https://www.significance-book.com/\n\nJim resides in Greenwood Village, Colorado, with his wife, Mary Jean. Their son, Dan, his wife, Tessa, and their daughter, Reise, live in Centennial, Colorado. Their daughter, Kate Livingston, resides in San Marcos, California, and does museum consulting and individual coaching",

  "description": "I became a Realtor 23 years ago largely because of a great experience I had with the realtor who helped my husband and I find our first home. My Realtor was patient, and helpful and full of knowledge about the neighborhoods and places my we were considering. He did not try to impose his view of where we should live and did not pressure us to make a decision. As a result we found a home we loved, in a community that many others would have discouraged us from considering. Because of this experience, I determined that helping people find their homes would be fulfilling and fun.\n\nI have never thought of myself as a salesperson but more as a matchmaker. Homes either are or are not right for people, If my clients get the right home for them then they are likely to be happy and use me again when they are ready to buy or sell. So, that is my job, matching people with homes that will make them as happy as my first realtor made me. Real Estate should be entertaining, It's like shopping, but the price tag is huge. I am a Denver native and my partner and I have renovated 7 homes over the past 25 years.  I have a masters in City Planning and have served on numberous city commissions and boards that work to make Denver a more livable, sustainable city,  so I can tell people about the houses they are considering and the neighborhoods that surround them. I think Denver is a great place to live.  Its many different neighborhoods, from Cherry Creek to Curtis Park, are fun to explore. I have lived throughout the city over my 50 years here, and know some places that others might not think to look. For the past 22 years, I have lived and worked mostly in the Five Points / RiNo / Curtis Park  area of Downtown and know these areas better than most any person in Denver.\n\nIf you are a buyer, I promise to work with you as long as it takes to find the house that makes you smile, without pressuring you to choose a certain neighborhood or make a decision faster. This is your home, the place you will spend your life, so it's OK if it takes a while to find the right fit.\n\nIf you are a seller, I think you should know there are three things that help match people with houses. How they show, How they are priced, and how they are advertised. These are the three variables we have to work with and I know how to work all three. When I start working with a seller, I hire a professional stager to review the property to help make sure it shows at its best. When I price a property, I go see the competition before I talk with the seller about the price of their home, and I work with Kentwood because they produce the best advertising in the city for homes. I understand that you are paying me a lot of money and I had better make sure I am worth every penny.",

  "description": "It has always been my mission to provide unparalleled client experiences and create strong partnerships with my clients based on trust, expertise, honesty, and impeccable service. Buying and listing campaigns are truly unique to each person and require in-depth insights into the current market conditions, strong real estate knowledge, mindful preparation, insightful counsel, and genuine, caring listening skills. I want my clients to feel that I have their back by providing effective, results-oriented negotiation skills, and I want them to also feel they can unquestionably rely on me to help them fully navigate the sales process to achieve their goals, not mine.\n\nI am an extremely proud member of the Kentwood family, and the professional and ethical standards that have made it such a highly respected, trusted brand and integral part of the Denver community. It has been my humble honor to receive the 2025 Denver Board of Realtors Silver Excellence Award for the third year in a row, and the 2025 Five Star Real Estate Professional Award, making it the sixth consecutive year to receive that wonderful recognition. It has equally been very rewarding to serve as a Board Member and Fundraising Committee Co-Chair for the Kentwood Cares Foundation.\n\nAs a Realtor for over 20 years, I have been a Member of the Denver Metro Association of Realtors, the South Metro Board of Realtors, the National Association of Realtors, and I hold the Graduate Realtor Institute Designation held by only 15% of realtors nationwide. I was raised in the San Diego area and relocated to this most beautiful state of Colorado 45 years ago, where I graduated with distinction from Colorado State University. I was honored to be a member of and captain the first Title IX Women’s Volleyball Team to its first-ever postseason national championship appearance. Junior Olympic Volleyball development was a very important part of my early professional life, and not only was I fortunate enough to coach at CSU, but I was also a Co-Founder and first Vice President of the Junior Olympic Division within USA Volleyball. Aside from my passion for real estate, some of my most favorite things now are playing golf, spending time with my family and friends, reading, gardening, hiking, walking my dog, and going to concerts. The beach is a long way away in both time and distance, but it’s still one of my most favorite places to spend the day!",

  "description": "Did you know there are over 1.5 million real estate agents in the United States? Very few make it their full-time career—and even fewer truly excel. If you're looking for a skilled, relationship-driven professional with deep local knowledge, proven results, and experience through multiple market cycles, meet Keri Duffy. She's been in real estate since the early 2000s and has watched Denver evolve into the dynamic city it is today.\n\nBased in Denver, Keri serves the greater metro area as a full-time, full-service Realtor® who helps people navigate real estate with clarity and confidence. She's worked with first-time buyers, clients struggling to downsize, and families navigating major life transitions—like helping sell the family home or managing an investment property sale from another state. Her client base is diverse: from truck drivers to tech professionals, nonprofit workers, medical professionals, and engineers. Whether it's couples just starting out, families seeking schools and community, or independent women looking for safety and security—whether you're buying your first place, selling a longtime home, or supporting a loved one through a move, Keri believes everyone deserves thoughtful guidance and strong representation.\n\nEmpathetic and grounded, she understands that life happens—and not every home is pristine. She's helped clients buy and sell hoarding properties, fixers, and investments. She's also worked with clients who value privacy and discretion. She's met movers, coordinated painters and cleaners, and handled on-site logistics for out-of-state sellers navigating difficult situations. Her approach is defined by consistency, resourcefulness, and trust—and it's shaped by your goals and your timeline. Whether it takes a few months or a few years, she stays in your corner.\n\nKeri's clients often describe her as a mix of \"protective sister\" and \"go-getter\"—someone who's both candid and direct. She's known for her fierce loyalty and for negotiating like it matters—because it does. One cooperating broker even called her \"a bulldog at the closing table\" in front of her client (who smiled and nodded). She takes that as a compliment.\n\nKeri also believes that every property has a story—and every listing deserves marketing that honors it. Selling in the 2025 market requires more than just uploading professional photos to the MLS. It takes creativity, market insight, and a network of trusted professionals—from roofing specialists to design-minded stagers. Her strategic, cross-platform marketing is designed to position each listing thoughtfully for the right audience, with the goal of netting her clients the most proceeds, on a timeline that works for you—minimizing risk to limit stress.\n\nPurchasing in 2025 requires more than an MLS auto-search and opening doors. Recent surveys show that 36% of buyers cite budget constraints as a barrier to purchase. First, she connects buyers with the right lenders—from credit specialists to jumbo or ARM products—and whether you have a W-2 or K-1, she has the right lender for you. Insurance is the latest challenge to the market, and she has great contacts there too. Thanks to her extensive agent network, Keri often learns about off-market and pre-MLS opportunities before the public. Can't find what you're looking for? Even with greater inventory, a recent 2025 survey found that 44% of buyers still can't find a property that meets their needs. She'll make the calls, write the letters, and tap into relationships built over decades. She's built a strong reputation not just with clients—but with fellow Realtors®, who often turn to her for advice and collaboration. That credibility matters—and translates to real access.\n\nHer passion lies in helping people build long-term financial security through real estate—whether it's a first home, a forever home, or a lock-and-leave lifestyle. Having moved 15 times across eight states as a child, she brings real empathy to every transition. She's also a trusted resource for clients relocating to Colorado, offering personalized insights on neighborhoods, schools, and lifestyle fit throughout the Denver metro area.\n\nKeri's real estate journey began behind the scenes—as a broker assistant. Under the mentorship of Kentwood CEO Gretchen Rosenberg and other luxury brokers, she earned what she calls a \"paid Master's degree\" in real estate. That foundation, combined with years of front-line experience, gives her a deep understanding of both the business and emotional sides of every transaction.\n\nKeri holds multiple professional designations, including Certified Negotiation Expert (CNE) and Senior Real Estate Specialist (SRES). She's served as a Director on the Board of the Denver Metro Association of Realtors® and remains active on the Market Trends, Government Affairs, and DMAR Gives Foundation Committees. She's been interviewed by 9News, 5280, and other publications and is a member of Kentwood's $10M Club, a DMAR Excellence Award winner, and a Five Star Professional honoree.\n\nOutside of real estate, you'll find her exploring Denver's dining scene or catching a show at Red Rocks. A former social butterfly turned homebody, she now enjoys Bravo or reading at home and going down interior design trends online. A self-proclaimed \"aspiring golfer and skier,\" Keri says her logo—the North Star—is more than just a design; it reflects her belief in guiding people toward what matters most: home, stability, and long-term financial security.",

  "description": "Rooted in faith, driven by purpose, I will hold your real estate dreams with precision and care. \n\n Hi, I’m Kristin. Stylist turned Real Estate Agent!\n\nYou might be thinking, why on earth would I work with a former hair stylist to help me on my real estate journey. Funny enough, it was the ultimate preparation for real estate–each client was trusting me with their physical experience while simultaneously sharing the personal details of their lives. I mastered multi-tasking, active listening, and taking the utmost care for my clients.\n\nStill, I never thought I would be where I am today, but I trusted God’s plans and now it has become much more than a job. It is my purpose. \n\nIn 2008, I bought my first home and without knowing what I was doing, proceeded to buy, sell, and flip 8 homes. I quickly saw the opportunity in the real estate market and became fascinated with how it could empower me. I negotiated two off-market properties, all without a license or formal education, and have now managed two rental properties.\n\nAlthough it was clear that real estate was something I enjoyed, developing it into a career was not in my plans. In early 2021, I was faced with a moment in time when everything changed. I needed to provide for my family and I asked God to show me the path of least resistance. \n\nThat path was to serve others as a guide on their own real estate journeys. Real estate is much more than buying or selling a property. It is a deeply personal experience that must be handled with precision and care. \n\nIt is with that mindset that I got my license in less than 3 months and had my very first closing for a client weeks later. This turned into a thriving business and I've been named one of the top 300 agents in Northern Colorado for two consecutive years.\n\nThe milestones and accolades are important, but helping families turn their real estate dreams into reality is my passion.  Your wealth, your journey, and your desires are like my own–I handle them with clarity and care.",

  "description": "LAURA FULLER  |  ASSOCIATE BROKER  |  KENTWOOD CITY PROPERTIES\n\nA self-declared “foodie,” when Laura is asked what restaurants she wants to try, she whips out her phone, and checks off the list she keeps meticulously. Not surprisingly, she credits her tireless attention to detail and focus on organization as keys to keeping her clients delighted, turning them into relationships for life. Of course, her Midwest work ethic and determination to succeed help too. “I never leave a stone unturned” beams Fuller.\n\nLaura is quick to credit her incredible team for many of her achievements. She is a 5280 Magazine 5 Star agent, a 2019 Rising Star and has averaged $6M in sales over the last three years. “My team has led Kentwood City Properties’ office for two years because we focus on making each other better and ignore traditional hierarchies.”\n\nAfter earning her degree in advertising from Michigan State, Laura followed the advice of mentors, ultimately getting her license while living in Chicago. “I recognized that real estate gave me the opportunity to set goals as big as I was willing to work hard.”\n\nBeginning Laura’s story talking about work might give the wrong impression. The pride she feels being a wife and mother exceeds anything she could ever accomplish with a business card. It is that balance which attracted her to the profession and the raving recommendation of three friends at Kentwood that brought her to Denver’s premiere brokerage.\n\n“I’m a big believer in Karma. Focusing as much on my family and community as much as my career, and always trying to pay things forward is a lesson I am teaching my daughters. It’s never too early in life to give your time, treasure and talents to those less fortunate.” \n\nLaura volunteers at her two daughters’ schools, The Denver Hospice Inpatient Care Center at Lowry, the Denver Mission and Dumb Friends League.\n\nLaura points to Ellen DeGeneres as a present-day hero. “The woman is relentlessly positive, kind, generous and brave.”\n\nLaura loves spending leisure time with her dog, skiing, golf and travel. She has explored 5 of the world’s 7 continents.",

  "description": "Living and working in the Denver and Boulder areas contributed to my exceptional knowledge of both communities. Attending the University of Colorado at Boulder framed my love for the town, and I still spend much of my free time visiting the city and helping real estate purchasers and sellers there.\n\nThe first home I purchased was in Denver's historic Montclair neighborhood; centrally located near my Kentwood office in Cherry Creek allowing me to concentrate on the areas of Stapleton, Lowry, Park Hill and more specifically Montclair. When my business began drawing me more and more to the north metro area, and seeing the rapid growth in that quadrant, I moved back to Erie in 2016, where my real estate career began.\n \nSince then, I have worked to cultivate an encyclopedic knowledge of where the greater community is and where it is going. I pride myself on being one of the first to know what and when new projects are coming to the area. I have an understanding of the unique pros and cons of each neighborhood in and around the Erie area, with a particular knowledge of Colliers Hill, where we make our home.\n\nAs a lifelong sports enthusiast, I played baseball and rugby collegiately. Now I expend the passion and energy required to excel in sports, to ensure that each client receives the uncompromising professionalism necessary to find their ideal home or obtain the highest value for an existing home. An enjoyment of sabermetrics in baseball has translated to a passion and proficiency for spotting and analyzing values and trends in the market place that give my clients an edge in making their real estate decisions and transactions.\n\nThe critical responsibilities inherent with helping people make the most important decision of their lives is taken seriously. Whether it means that I strap on my boots and hike over 30 mountain acres or work into the wee hours of the morning, I am going to make sure you have the right information to make the best decision possible. I accept that trust and wouldn't be happier doing anything else. Let me know how I can be of service to you with your next big decision!",

Sometimes, we have even been able to be the winning offer without being the highest price. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the Hotz name is well known among Denver real estate agents\".\n\nSearch the Denver MLS\n\n\"Searching the Denver MLS alone is not the best way to find new listings. National portals like Zillow have many old listings that are not even still for sale. However, our website All Denver Real Estate offers all current Denver MLS listings and its actually updated with new listings for sale every 15 minutes. Plus, I can sometimes find listings to show that aren't even in the Denver MLS through my office and broker connections.\" By the way, Be sure to check our own mobile application for Denver home searches.

I believe in the power of community and the importance of supporting those around me. My career path has been shaped by a strong desire to see my friends, family, and clients succeed. \n\nTo me, real estate is more than just buying and selling properties—it’s about providing the flexibility and security that can truly change lives. I’ve witnessed firsthand how owning real estate can create opportunities, reduce struggles, and set people up for long-term success. This is why I’m so passionate about helping first-time homebuyers and anyone looking to build a better future through real estate. \n\nI’m driven by the belief that the American dream is built on the foundation of homeownership. My clients are not just transactions to me; they’re friends—people I genuinely care about and want to see thrive. Every relationship I build in this industry is one I value deeply, and I’m committed to being there for my clients, providing guidance and support throughout the entire process. \n\nAt Kentwood Real Estate, my mission is simple: I want to ensure that the people I work with and choose to build relationships with are happy and confident in the decision they make. \n\nOutside of real estate, I have a deep love for cars and exploring the culinary scene. In fact, I’d probably travel for food before I’d travel for the destination—I find that some of life’s most exciting moments are around a table! These passions keep me energized and remind me of the importance of enjoying life’s journey, both personally and professionally. \n\nI believe in the power of homeownership to transform lives, and I’m passionate about helping my clients achieve the success and stability they deserve. When you work with me, you’re not just another client—you’re a valued friend, and I’m committed to being there for you every step of the way.",

  "description": "Nicole is a Colorado native who grew up in Highlands Ranch and couldn't be happier to call Colorado her home! She has traveled to 43 states, and none of them offers the lifestyle that Colorado does. During her childhood, Nicole's Dad worked as a lender and spent a lot of time working from their home. She was able to assist him with all aspects of his business, gradually gaining insights into the complex world of Real Estate from a lender's perspective. After her dad's 25+ years in the business, he transitioned from a desk job to rehabbing homes in the Denver Metro Area. At that point, it was only natural for Nicole to obtain her license and start working alongside her Dad, renovating and selling homes. It was scary to venture into something new after years of working for a Sports Marketing company, but she took the plunge because sticking to the status quo was even scarier.\n\nNicole has been licensed for 10 years and has assisted over 200 families in finding their first home, selling their childhood homes, purchasing their next investment property, or moving into their dream house. She is also a proud mom to a 2.5-year-old son and a loving wife to her husband, Shawn. Whether you're buying or selling a home, it's a deeply personal experience. It could be the home you've always dreamed of buying or your childhood home filled with memories. In any case, Nicole cares about what that home means to you. She takes the time to get to know her clients and cultivate lifelong friendships because real estate is a personal business, and her clients are the most important aspect to her.",

Growing up in a Denver real estate investment family, Nori’s education and interest in real estate started in early childhood and eventually propelled her to attain a bachelor’s degree in real estate from the University of Denver.\n\nNori’s real estate career began with the global investment management firm BlackRock in Newport Beach, California, where she worked in commercial real estate asset management (mainly apartments) in various submarkets throughout Southern California and Texas. Nori says the most valuable takeaway from her time with BlackRock was entering into the position in early 2008, just before the start of the Great Recession. “Working through a notoriously difficult period in real estate at the very start of my career gave me invaluable insight and experience that I have been able to apply throughout my entire career in real estate,” says Nori.\n\nNori’s subsequent positions in real estate have all been local to Colorado; having worked in the beautiful Vail Valley with Slifer Smith & Frampton Real Estate (residential brokerage) and most recently working as the director of operations for a small commercial real estate private equity firm, specializing mainly in apartment syndications. \n\nOutside of work, Nori loves spending time with her energetic 6-year old boy running from one sport to the next and getting a “master’s” education on all things Marvel Superheroes and the NFL.",

  "description": "2020 marks Pat Wall’s 42nd year in residential real estate.\n\nIn May, she was awarded the prestigious Realtor Emeritus designation by the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThis honor is for the select few brokers who have  been NAR members for 40 years and given  back to the industry. She has had a career of 4 decades as a \"Top Producer\". Receiving honors as a DMAR Excellence Award winner and 5 Star Professional every  year.  Her other designations are GRI ( Graduate of Realtor Institute) MRE ( Masters in Real Estate) CRS ( Council of  Residential Specialists) and in 2017  the SRS ( Seller Representative Specialist ).\n\n Her career started in 1977 at Van Schaack & Company  in Cherry Creek.  In 1990, she joined her colleagues who had formed The Kentwood Company.  Pat is a Denver native and alum of the University of Colorado (chemistry).  Her background is in the apparel industry (retail, wholesale & manufacturing her own  clothing company: PAT ON THE BACK in Los Angeles.) This accounts for her excellent business knowledge and negotiating  skills.  Known for her creative marketing  campaigns—she just launched her new website: cherrycreekrestaurants.com. The site is  a continuation of her first promotional campaign from 1979 based on her list of Cherry Creek restaurants. The new website features her  famous list of restaurants plus access to active listings. “Where is THE CHERRY” is Pat’s trademarked social media  campaign that follows a 3 foot tall cherry around Cherry Creek.   \n\nShe has served  on the Board of Directors  for Hilltop and University Park. In 2000 she started the University Park Home Tour. Her expertise extends from Cherry Creek to Cherry Hills.\n\nShe is adamant about real estate as the vehicle for funding a college education. Ask her about Wall College Fund LLC.\n\nHer years have taught her there is a better way to prepare her clients. She strives to make her sellers the best in the market with programs  like Target  Date Marketing and the Good Home Guarantee.  According to Kentwood Managing Broker, Brandon Brennick: “Pat does the details so well. Her uncanny ability to price property and keen sense of telling a home’s story have made her and her clients very successful!”\n\nPat’s Mother was a real estate  broker and helped Pat purchase her first home at 20. Pat’s son, Peter is a lobbyist and represents Denver Metro Association of Realtors. Peter received an award presented by Mayor Hancock in 2017 for his service as Governmental Affairs Director for DMAR.",

  "description": "Growing up in rural Ohio, I couldn’t wait to escape to the big city of Los Angeles. After 25 years of all that a big city offered, I came back to my roots – small town Colorado.\n\nMy family and I have been living in Boulder County since 2001, and prior to that we lived in the southern suburbs of Denver. We couldn’t be happier in Boulder County as it’s a wonderful fit. We love the mountain views of Longs Peak, the quaint mining towns, and open spaces.\n\nWhen I moved to California, I was star struck. I immediately put my administrative skills, which I honed at the University of Kentucky, to good use and worked in or around the film industry until 1976, when I discovered real estate. I met my husband, who was a fellow Realtor, in 1980 and our son was born in 1985. In California, I was very involved, and a founding board member of, Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times, which was one of the first camps for children and families of children with cancer, as well as President of the First Christian Church Nursery School, Vice President of the Carpenter Avenue PTA and school volunteer. After coming to Colorado, I have participated in the AIDS walk, Bolder Boulder and volunteered at Dressed for Success.\n\nI love real estate. I take a personal interest in my clients and many of them have become extremely close friends throughout my career. With all the internet sites and cyber feeds out there, clients still need to know they have a human being that is taking care of them and watching out for them. I am proud of the repeat business and referrals I have attained and the exceptional customer satisfaction.\n\nI specialize in the Boulder County area and northern suburbs of Denver. However, since my first seven years in Colorado were spent in Littleton, I continue to service clients in and around Denver as well.  Having lived in Niwot and currently living in Erie, I am part of the community. The eastern portion of Boulder County is expanding tremendously, while the Boulder area remains protected by open space, with homeowners expanding and updating existing properties.\n\nSince 2000, I have been associated with Kentwood Real Estate, one of the premier real estate offices in the nation. I can’t imagine working anywhere else. The respect this company demands makes me proud to be a member of this firm.\n\nSellers and purchasers alike, whether they are dealing in starter condominiums or multi-million-dollar estates, know “They have a friend in me.”",

Through hard work, knowledge, kindness, and integrity, she makes sure every transaction is completed with detailed focus and continued communication throughout the process.\n\nShe works to exceed expectations with everyone she works with.\n\nA little bit about how she got into real estate:\n\nAs her family came to America, her father became friends with a gentleman on the journey. Her father asked him what is the best way to make a good living for my family in America? The gentleman replied, \"real estate\", and the rest is history. Renita learned from her parents at a very young age what real estate is all about.\n\nIn August 1988, at the age of 25, she bought her first property, a duplex. She lived in one half and rented the other half. That was the beginning of her real estate career. Since then, she bought, sold, managed, and held investment properties. Several years ago, she changed from investor to helping folks achieve their vision of home ownership.\n\nThe things that light up her life are the relationships, guiding folks through complicated real estate transactions, and learning all things real estate.\n\n“I get to learn all I can about the market and all areas of real estate so I can be the best possible resource for YOU!  Let’s say I “nerd out” about these things so you don’t have to.”\n\nI love all things wine – exploring different flavors and socializing.\n\nI love to read – the best way to relax and enjoy a good story.\n\nI love cooking – it’s my favorite way to show my creative side.\n\nI love traveling – experiencing and emersion into new cultures.\n\nSome people may be surprised to learn that I am a retired pharmacist, I have a twin sister and speak fluent German.\n\nAre we a good fit?\n\n* A member of DMAR (Denver Metro Association of Realtors), CAR (Colorado Association of Realtors), NAR (National Association of Realtors, LPI (Luxury Portfolio International)\n\n* A certified real estate negotiator (CREN)\n\n*Areas of expertise are new builds, 1031 exchange and HUD homes\n\n*Specialize in all cities on the west side of Denver from Arvada, Golden to Roxborough, Colorado Springs and Pueblo",

I graduated from Fort Collins High School and earned a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from CU Boulder and an MBA from Colorado State University. I started working at Woodward, Inc. when I was just 14 years old and grew in the company for the next 28 years, ultimately becoming the director of engineering. My background in engineering honed my problem-solving skills and instilled a strong work ethic that I have carried into my real estate endeavors.\n\nWhile I became a real estate agent in 2015, my connection with real estate actually dates back to 1999 when I started investing in properties. Over the years, I've amassed a wealth of experience and skills that translate seamlessly into my work as an agent. I'm not just a real estate professional; I'm a hands-on home remodeler and a licensed general contractor with expertise in electrical work, plumbing, framing, tiling, roofing, and painting, among other essential skills. With my extensive professional background and strong project management skills, I can oversee the real estate process from start to finish, ensuring you get the best deal. My goal is to make the journey both smooth and enjoyable, helping you achieve your housing dreams, whether you're buying your first home or selling a property. Clients have described me as professional, knowledgeable, hardworking, trustworthy, personable, responsive, efficient, patient, and dedicated.\n\nI'm happily married with three kids and a young step-daughter — plus our cat, Teacup. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, skiing, biking, and just about any outdoor activity. I also have a passion for home renovation and love taking on projects that allow me to apply my skills and creativity. I'm a volunteer for the Red Cross, giving back to my community and making a positive impact where I can.",

  "description": "Sean and Debbie are seasoned real estate professionals who truly believe their value to their clients has to be earned every day and know that the reputation they keep is only as good as their last client’s experience.  “Our commitment to our clients’ needs and welfare is all that lasts when the job is completed.  Our successes don’t mean anything until the clients know they can trust us and we always aim to never let them down.  We are committed to never taking our clients’ sacred bond of trust for granted.  Our philosophy of business is to exceed our client’s expectations.”\n\nSean and Debbie have never believed that they can best service their clients by specializing in a single segment of the market but rather adapting to the changing market conditions and needs of their clients.  Their business has been almost exclusively referral and repeat clients for many years.  The formula that has led to their success is an extensive knowledge of current market conditions and listening closely to what their clients are ultimately trying to achieve.  Whether it’s representing buyers to find that “perfect” home in the perfect neighborhood to listing and marketing a seller’s home, the goal remains the same – helping their clients achieve their goals.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Rhode Island and attaining a Master’s in Education from Boston University, Debbie returned to her native roots of Colorado to teach special education.  However, Real Estate was in her blood and she embarked on creating a successful Real Estate career in 2001.  Raised in Colorado, Sean is a proud Graduate of Creighton University, Marquette University and the University of Denver.  Prior to working with Debbie, Sean spent 10 years working as a Civil Engineer for a local Colorado Company.  Debbie’s successes led to new opportunities and Sean left engineering to help Debbie leverage her opportunities in 2005.  “I never expected to find such enjoyment in a career.  Our successes are always our client’s successes and I look forward to meeting these lofty aspirations in the future.”  Their diverse educational and professional experiences only enhance their expertise.\n \nWith over two decades of combined real estate experience, the Larkin team are full service brokers who stay up on market trends and the latest technology to make transactions and communication with clients seamless.   Sean and Debbie have been recognized in the Denver Metro area by The Denver Business Journal in the “Who’s Who in Denver Business” issue and Million Dollar Round Table awards.  “We feel it is important to know the market and listen to buyers, sellers fellow brokers in order to adapt a marketing strategy specific to each individual party and property.”\n\nSean and Debbie live in Cherry Hills and have two children, Kaitlin and Connor.  Having children themselves, and working with numerous families with young children has made them extraordinarily knowledgeable about the various school systems in the Denver area. They welcome the opportunity to discuss a family’s educational goals simultaneously to their wants and needs in terms of a new home.",

  "description": "I moved to Colorado from Goshen, Indiana over 30 years ago and now live in Greeley, Colorado with my fabulous husband Orest Dubynsky and my two fur babies Mr. Quigley and Fergus. They are West Highland Terriers.  In Indiana, I became a Registered Nurse and then received my degree in Business Management in Colorado. \n\nAfter working in nursing administration for many years, first with RVNA as Program Director in Greeley then as Director of Home Care and Hospice at Estes Park Medical Center, I opened a retail business in Estes. For 24 years, this shop featured supplies and inspiration for knitting, needlework and quilting projects.\n\n My love for Real Estate began in Indiana where I worked as a Realtor with Century 21.  When I moved to Colorado, I got my Real Estate License in 2019.  Before 2019, I indulged in one of my favorite things to do.  Buying properties to fix up, resell or rent. \n\nLiving in Colorado feeds into my passion for the outdoors, wildlife and enjoying the world around me. Knitting is my other true love which doesn’t fit my type A personality, but it is truly my Jam!! I volunteer with NoCo Humane Society in Evans and Habitat for Humanity. I am a member of the National Association of Realtors and Greeley Area Board of Realtors. I have received the designation of Accredited Buyer’s Representative (ABR) and have complete the course for Certified Real Estate Negotiator\n\nSusan would love to connect with you to learn more about you, your real estate dreams and talk about living the Colorado lifestyle.",

  "description": "Selecting Real Estate as a profession involves more than helping clients buy or sell property.  For most people, the purchase or sale of a home, vacation property, or as part of an investment portfolio, is among the biggest financial transactions they will ever experience.  I believe the best realtor is one who can learn the needs and desires of their clients and work diligently to ensure that the client obtains the best possible outcome while minimizing stress and uncertainty for all concerned.\n\nWhen it’s time to buy or sell, you can rely upon me to provide timely, accurate, and transparent communication and solution-oriented negotiations. I’ll provide you with personalized service and support from start to finish.\n\nI became a realtor because I have a passion for helping people. If you’re shopping for a home, we’ll tour several homes and explore appropriate neighborhoods. I’ll provide my industry knowledge and insight and patiently help you find the perfect fit for your family and your financial goals.\n\nIf you are selling your home, we will work through the preparation and emotions together to ensure that you receive top dollar for your house. My focus is to meet your specific needs, and I’ll never ask you to compromise on what matters most to you. I will expertly navigate the process and continuously represent your best interests. You will always be aware of what’s happening, and you will know what to expect next.\n\nIn addition to real estate, I enjoy being on the lake, traveling and spending quality time with my husband and children. I live in the same neighborhood where I grew up, which offers a strong sense of community, wonderful quality of life, and easy access to nature.\n\nWhether you’re a first-time buyer, third-time seller, or seasoned investor, I would be thrilled to meet you and put my real estate knowledge and experience to work for you. Lakefront or mountain property? I’m your agent. Ready to get started? Give me a call if you’re looking for an agent who will be responsive and guide you through each step. I am patient yet persistent, and I strive to meet or exceed your greatest expectations.",

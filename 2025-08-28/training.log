Advanced Python – Covered core concepts including :
                functions, classes, objects, OOP principles, 
                self argument, constructors & destructors, file operations, 
                positional arguments (*args), keyword arguments (kwargs)
                Core functions including  generators, return & yield usage,
                error handling (try/except), string formatting, module importing, 
                Python memory references, list comprehensions, exceptions & errors,
                code readability, optimization, and reliability.
                Also Python standards (PEP8) and best coding practices.

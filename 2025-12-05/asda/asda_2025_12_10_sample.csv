Brown your protein (e.g. chicken, meat or paneer). Unleash the aromas: Add the sauce kit into the same saucepan. Cook gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring to prevent burning. Release the fragrant flavours. Build the base: Fill the empty sauce pot (300ml) with water and add it to the saucepan. Simmer to perfection: Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stir occasionally, watch it thicken. Add delicate ingredients like seafood or vegetables during cooking adjusting the time as needed. Enjoy your Tuk Tuk meal. Top tips: Want more sauce, add more water. Want a thicker sauce, cook uncovered. For creamy less spicy twist, add coconut milk.||May contain traces of Sesame.|||||Typical values per 100g. per 100g: ,Energy - 1049KJ /269 kcal ,Fat - 16g ,of which saturates - 3.0g ,Carbohydrates - 12g ,of which sugars - 11g ,Fibre - 4.2g ,Protein - 4.4g ,Salt - 2.6g||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||https://asdagroceries.scene7.com/is/image/asdagroceries/5070002918417|||||9247153||||||||507000291841|Hand Finished Sauce Kits.

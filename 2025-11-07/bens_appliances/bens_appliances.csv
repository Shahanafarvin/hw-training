Click here Made of ADC12 and zinc alloy, these hubs are a massive upgrade from the traditional Whirlpool washing machine hubs that can strip out when the gear shaft has been compromised and will give an otherwise condemned machine new life. Whirlpool used to utilize these in older-era machines and removed them from factory installation on or around 2014, but continued selling the hubs for legacy models. Unbeknownst to most technicians, this hub would be forward-compatible with any unit that utilizes W10528947 hubs. Version 2: Due to selling so many of these hubs, we've created a major revision from the factory that produced the hubs for us. We were the 1st company to create an aftermarket version which many companies copied. The new V2 hub has: Additional tangs on the hub for better retention of the drive block Revised / Thicker drive block for better tightening onto drive shaft Deeper splines of hub to drive into gearcase for better adhesion to degraded drive shaft systems. These were all updates/upgrades to the system that we believe improve performance above and beyond competitors, including the Whirlpool OEM solution. Installation Instructions (MUST CLICK!) Note that you MUST use blue threadlocker on the tub nut to secure it properly to the drive block. This is not included with the orders as many customers may already have this (locktite, ect). If you do not have any, please consider ordering the 2ml tube which contains enough to properly lock the tub nut, as well as wash bolt into place. Additionally, a spanner wrench is needed to lock the nut in place. It requires the common TB123A or B wrench, which we do carry.

It is approximately 9"", and the Molex harness style should be noted. If this part goes bad in your refrigerator, it can cause temperatures to be erratic, or too high or low, depending on how it failed, as well as premature defrost termination. A typical sensor such as this one should measure 5,000 ohms @ 77*F when tested with a multimeter.

https://bens-appliances.com/products/bounce-b-gone-washing-machine-suspension-grease-ba-80048,50ml Bounce-B-Gone Washing Machine Suspension Grease and Foam Set BA-80048,Ben's Appliances,$15.99,"If your washing machine is bouncing, try this! Now includes 4 Foam inserts for Samsung Suspension Rods as well. For years, if your washing machine was bouncing around, causing noise, unbalanced loads, or other issues, there has been one straight and expensive solution: Replace the suspension rods. However, in the vast majority of situations where the washing machine has an issue, the rods aren't the problem, per-se, its the dampening system. Over years of use, factory greases and dampening systems degrade due to general use or more rapidly due to overloading. Our kinematic grease restores your machines damping rods to factory or beyond-factory quality at a fraction of the price. Additionally packed in the kit are 4x pieces of replacement foam for your suspension system. In many cases, the foam degrades over time, requiring replacement along with the grease. Although potentially optional in some cases, feedback on the foam with the grease has been beyond positive, so they are now included in each pack. Simply apply the grease to wherever the damping system is, and it will slow the motion of the rods' rapid movement in spin mode. There are many DIY fixes on the market for all model washers, but a factory-designed grease offers a solution for all makes and models of washing machines using rod & spring dampng systems. Better yet, this works to restore shock absorbers on front load machines too! As crazy as it is, this is a one-size-fits-all solution to one of the most vexxing problems of machines.

If the existing defrost sensor is off-specification, it could reduce the defrost time of the refrigerator, causing some of the icing conditions that the Samsung refrigerator is notorious for. Always confirm that this piece is compatible with your refrigerator prior to purchase. However, this specific sensor is compatible with almost all Samsung French-door refrigerators and side-by-side units. Can also be used to replace the DA32-10104N if they're out of stock.",,,,,,,,True,https://bens-appliances.com/cdn/shop/products/da32-00006wfront_800x.png?v=1626579507,

https://bens-appliances.com/products/samsung-icemaker-leak-moisture-kit,Samsung Ice Maker & Moisture Heater Kit,Ben's Appliances and Junk,$30.99,"An Affordable Package to Help Out Your Samsung SpaceMaker Ice Maker's Woes! The most common question we get regarding Samsung Refrigerators is ""How can I fix my Ice maker which keeps getting iced over?"" The answer is to prevent moisture build-up in the cabinet. There are many ways to do this, including the Secondary Heater Kit we currently sell for the evaporator system. But this kit gives you an additional, affordable way of helping to mitigate the icing issue: by sealing the cabinet, installing drain clips, and the new icemaker retainer (which can get damaged via the icing issue in the first place), and a larger revised drain tube and heater, you may be able to prevent or eliminate icing issues. Our New Revised ""Complete Kit"", includes the following items: New, Revised DA97-19898A Drain Tube with Pre-Installed 3M Sealant and 2.3w DC Drop-In Heater (OEM Ugpgraded Style) by Choice Parts Mfg. DA82-02367B Y-Clip and Retention Set Silco Sil-Bond RTV 4500 Food Grade Sealant (Info: http://www.silco-inc.com/p_sb_4500.htm ) Installation Guide with other additional no-cost fixes and solutions We also offer other kit options such as: DA97-19898A Drain Tube with Pre-Installed 3M Sealant and 2.3w DC Drop-In Heater (OEM Ugpgraded Style) - If in case yours has been damaged, or you've purchased our other kits in the past and need only the drain tube with the revised heater. Icemaker Moisture Kit - This kit is the preferred kit if you are replacing the Samsung Ice Maker Auger, as the augers we sell will already include the revised drain-tube pre-installed. This comes with the DA82-02367A Y-Clip and Retainer Set, as well as a 3oz Bottle of SIL-4500 food grade sealant. Icemaker Heater Kit Only - If you prefer to only get the heater kit and keep the older style drain tube, you can purchase only the heating system and sealant kit with the Frost King R3.0 tape and additional HVAC foil tape for sealing the unit. Moisture and Heater Kit Without Tube - This is a more affordable choice without the drain tube, as we produce the heater kit ourselves which is available at a lower bundled price. Installation Guide for Moisture leak kit and heater kit: https://bit.ly/2Ur2n5n This kit will not repair a broken ice maker, or a warped/damaged icemaker box. Other than the control board and icemaker, our kit contains a similar or better solution than Samsungs to repair your icemaker!

With the addition of an inline switch, you can cut power to the heater only, without needing to disassemble the unit and remove the heater kit after each winter season. To install the kit, you only need a 3/4"" drill bit, and a screwdriver to remove the cold control assembly and defrost timer to install the switch and heater kit.

This is the exact same recipe as the smaller, 50ml jar size which is perfect for a few washing machines. The larger 500ml tub is designed for appliance repair techs that need to refurbish dozens, if not 100 washing machines to prevent them from jumping around. Product size: 500ml jar (internal capacity) / 1.1b of damping grease. Product is 1.4lb including jar and lid. _____________________ For years, if your washing machine was bouncing around, causing noise, unbalanced loads, or other issues, there has been one straight and expensive solution: Replace the suspension rods. However, in the vast majority of situations where the washing machine has an issue, the rods aren't the problem, per-se, its the dampening system. Over years of use, factory greases and dampening systems degrade due to general use or more rapidly due to overloading. Our kinematic grease restores your machines damping rods to factory or beyond-factory quality at a fraction of the price. Simply apply the grease to wherever the damping system is, and it will slow the motion of the rods' rapid movement in spin mode. There are many DIY fixes on the market for all model washers, but a factory-designed grease offers a solution for all makes and models of washing machines using rod & spring dampng systems. Better yet, this works to restore shock absorbers on front load machines too! As crazy as it is, this is a one-size-fits-all solution to one of the most vexxing problems of machines. Although the grease comes in a small 20ml jar, it is enough grease to restore between 4-8 machines. 500ml jars will be available in the near future as well for servicers that require larger more frequent repairs of washing machines.

In rare instances it is another component, or a deeper issue with the interface. With many interface boards costing well over 10x the kit, we think its well worth using even if you own a Maytag or Whirlpool washer and haven't quite yet seen the corrosion problem. Chemicals Note: This kit contains a silicone-based conformal coating. It is both flamable and toxic for consumption. We reccomend you use gloves and use with caution in a well ventilated area.

Many of these are under the Maytag ""Bravos"" and Whirlpool ""Cabrio"" designations. A hub being stripped will cause the wash plate to move independently of the tub without the unit being in the proper shifted mode. This can cause many issues, especially making the washing machine not spin properly. This set comes with 3 pieces to ensure you have the right set of items to match your needed solution. This solution is our own, new in-house, all-metal hub set. The two larger hubs are made with ADC-12 and the smaller ring is made with stainless steel. Each kit comes with the 3 hub pieces. Your washing machine will either use the larger hub, or the smaller hub with the stainless interior ring, and since these vary from model to model, they are sold in a 3-piece set.

https://bens-appliances.com/products/appliance-cleaning-kit-for-refrigerators-and-dryers,Appliance Cleaning Kit for Refrigerators and Dryers,Ben's Appliances and Junk,$26.99,"A Dirty Appliance Can Cost More Than a New One You've probably seen a few appliances being cleaned in a video before, and here's the truth: dust and dirt can do a lot of horrible things in your home. Not only can it shorten the lifespan of a refrigerator or dryer, but it can cause them to run longer to operate, which will make your electric or gas bills shoot up. A Dirty Refrigerator coil can cause it to run and run and run. This is why we include multiple items in this kit to not only clean the outside of the coil system, but the inside where a standard refrigeration brush can't work. The flexible vaccum hose attachment is small and flexible, allowing you to hit the far reaches of the refrigerator, as the hose runs approximately 2ft long, in addition to the soft silicone adaptor that works for virtually any refrigerator. The kit also includes a 15"" condenser brush for pulling caked-on dirt from both the fridge and dryer. We also include a 9"" mountable condenser brush for your corded or cordless drill. Dryer lint will cause your dryer to run longer, and risk blowing sensors, costing you a LOT of money Many of the times we sell appliance parts or fix a customer's dryer, its not because the dryer simply broke, but because the vent was clogged. Although we're totally happy with selling parts and dryers, if the core problem isn't fixed, guess what? It'll happen again. Roughly half of the dryers we sell, go in houses where the old one broke due to a vent being restricted, clogged, or just plain destroyed. This brush set is a fraction of the price of a service call, or especially a dryer! Included in Each Kit is: 4-Inch Wide Dryer Vent Brush for ripping the lint out of your dryer vent, freeing it of all dust and dirt restrictions 15-Inch Long Condenser Coil Brush for both the dryer and refrigerator - it will brush off any caked on dirt without being too unwieldy long 9-Inch Long Drill-Mounted Condenser Brush when needed to really remove dirt from a hard to reach area in the refrigerator or dryer 12 Feet of Flexible Brush Extensions for the Brush System + Cordless Drill Adapters the extensions are meant to go through your whole vent ductwork to push, pull, and rip out the garbage that's caked in your vent system. We also can add extra extensions to your kit as needed! 30 Feet of Adhesive Tape for Brush Extensions Many users on other kits complain about the risk of extensions coming undone - we include the tape with every kit for extra security on your brush cleaning system Flexible Vaccum Cleaner Hose System for your refrigerator, to clean out all the parts you can't see. Just because you have cleaned the front of the coils doesn't mean there aren't dust bunnies lurking - the cleaner hose solves that, quickly.",,,,,,,,True,"https://bens-appliances.com/cdn/shop/products/BrushKitAll_800x.jpg?v=1642026907, https://bens-appliances.com/cdn/shop/products/LintLizard_800x.jpg?v=1642026908, https://bens-appliances.com/cdn/shop/products/H876095a503c947a393ead2b1784531b8h_800x.png?v=1642026908",

This is the exact same recipe as the smaller, 50ml jar size which is perfect for a few washing machines. The larger 500ml tub is designed for appliance repair techs that need to refurbish dozens, if not 100 washing machines to prevent them from jumping around. Product size: 500ml jar (internal capacity) / 1.1b of damping grease. Product is 1.4lb including jar and lid. _____________________ For years, if your washing machine was bouncing around, causing noise, unbalanced loads, or other issues, there has been one straight and expensive solution: Replace the suspension rods. However, in the vast majority of situations where the washing machine has an issue, the rods aren't the problem, per-se, its the dampening system. Over years of use, factory greases and dampening systems degrade due to general use or more rapidly due to overloading. Our kinematic grease restores your machines damping rods to factory or beyond-factory quality at a fraction of the price. Simply apply the grease to wherever the damping system is, and it will slow the motion of the rods' rapid movement in spin mode. There are many DIY fixes on the market for all model washers, but a factory-designed grease offers a solution for all makes and models of washing machines using rod & spring dampening systems. Better yet, this works to restore shock absorbers on front load machines too! As crazy as it is, this is a one-size-fits-all solution to one of the most vexxing problems of machines. Although the grease comes in a small 20ml jar, it is enough grease to restore between 4-8 machines. 500ml jars will be available in the near future as well for servicers that require larger more frequent repairs of washing machines.

Since releasing in April 2022, we've added roughly 12 brand new relays to the set to ensure that it covers more problem appliances. We are offering two styles of kits in this set - this listing includes the organizer AND ADP51B62M02 pressure transducers. We will have a secondary kit that do not include the organizer or sensors at a reduced price. The kit includes: 63 unique relays with many doubled, totalling 109 pieces 17 common capacitor types with multiples for all, totalling 83 pieces Common resistors for Electrolux ranges, and then the Whirlpool/Maytag Pressure transducers that are seeing widespread failures and recalls from our improved, trusted source. Supplies / stock of this set are limited and once sold out may not be back in stock again due to the nature of obsolete relays that cannot be re-acquired.

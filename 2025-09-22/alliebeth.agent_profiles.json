  "description": "As the No. 1 real estate agent in Texas, the No. 1 luxury agent in Dallas/Fort Worth, plus the 32nd top-producing agent in the United States, Alex Perry has built his business on a solutions-based mindset.\nThe challenges of the current market – struggling to find inventory, especially homes that are priced for both a willing buyer and a willing seller – have only motivated him more.\nAlex averaged more than $1 million in sales per day in 2021, totaling more than $375 million in volume for his best year to date and cementing his spot as the leading luxury real estate agent in the region. His goal remains the same: to find the perfect home for his clients before it hits the market, so they’re paying fair market price and not more.\nBeing able to track down those before-market and private sales has made all the difference.\n“If you approach everything with a solutions-based mindset, you succeed,” Alex explained. “There will always be problems. A strong work ethic and knowledge of the market is not a secret. That’s always been the way to succeed in this business.”\nNotably, he sold two homes in 2021 offered at more than $20 million, including a home in Volk Estates, the prestigious University Park enclave, that set recent records for Park Cities sales.\nHe calls his achievements a collaborative effort, noting that every successful transaction requires multiple parties, from other agents to appraisers, title companies, and the people he works with in sales and marketing at Allie Beth Allman & Associates.\n“People and relationships are the center of my success,” he said. “Each year – or each quarter – the market could require new strategies, but creating partnerships with people to solve problems will be a constant. That strategy transcends all markets.”\nA Southern Methodist University graduate, Alex holds a Real Estate Finance degree from the Cox School of Business. He is experienced in high-end home sales, representing both sellers and buyers, while specializing in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow and surrounding neighborhoods. \nIn addition to his ranking as #1 in Dallas and Texas by RealTrends/The Wall Street Journal, Alex has consistently ranked as a D Best Top Producer and Best Realtor each year by D Magazine. He has been a top-producing agent with Allie Beth Allman & Associates for more than a decade.\nSocially, he is a big sports enthusiast.

  "description": "Ashley Rasmussen has called Texas home for over 24 years. As a result, she has an excellent source of knowledge on the local market, with an incomparable network of contacts and resources that form the foundation of her success in real estate.\nWith a results-based work ethic and commitment to client service, she describes herself as “hyper-focused,” driven by her dedication to reliability, transparency, accessibility, and a strong desire to close business for her clients.\nAshley has been frequently recognized for her accomplishments with prestigious industry honors throughout her real estate career. She’s been named top producer at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, as well as top realtor for five years (2014-2018, 2020) by D Magazine. Her professional training includes certification by the GRI (Graduate Realtor Institute) and the ABR (Accredited Buyer Representative), as well as the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing and Historic Home Specialist.\n“My values are honesty, integrity, and respect for others – all three are important to me and, in my experience, the only way to achieve true success,” she explains. “I like helping, serving people, and making a difference in my home and community. I’m a hard worker, dedicated, compassionate, and adaptable with strong communication skills.”\nOn September 8, 2021, Ashley, and Chris Pyle launched the Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. It was a bold new stroke for the longtime friends and real estate associates. “Chris and I decided to join forces and form our own team at Allie Beth Allman & Associates,” she explains. Ashley calls creating a new team, “an easy decision,” due to the pair’s years of working together at The Haven Group, which Pyle founded in 2007. “We have similar beliefs and culture,” she says. “By pooling our time, experience, and resources we can offer an accelerated top-level service to our treasured clients.”\nAshley says she works with a wide range of clients -- from first-time buyers to seasoned sellers. She enjoys working with clients relocating to Dallas and “showing off our beautiful city,” as she describes it, specializing in the Park Cities, where she lives with her family. She also has a depth of experience in East Dallas, Lake Highlands, Preston Hollow, and Bluffview.\nBrand differentiation is important to Ashley. “My top-notch customer service and passion for the ‘importance of home’ fortifies a deeply held belief that the process of buying and selling is a vital, intimate, and emotional one that requires thorough, honest, and steady advice … every step of the way.”\nAnd it is that differentiation that drives her real estate acumen. At the top of her list is a devotion to quality customer service delivered in her signature calm, personable, and positive style. “Past clients have shared that they appreciate my exceptional customer service, negotiation and problem-solving skills, as well as my patience, and staying involved during, and after the transaction.”\nA Shreveport, LA native, Ashley has been married for 25 years to Paul Rasmussen, Senior Minister at Highland Park United Methodist Church. The couple are parents to three children: PJ is a senior at The University of Texas-Austin; Arden, a sophomore, also at The University of Texas-Austin; and Luke, who is a junior at Shelton School in Dallas. Beyond a deep knowledge of various local communities, another of Ashley’s greatest strengths, she says, is understanding area school districts.\n“For one reason or another, early on our three children ended up in different school systems,” she explains. “When it comes to education – private vs. public, and so on -- I bring a wealth of information to clients.”\nAshley received her bachelor’s degree in Business Administration at Northwestern State University as well as a master’s degree in Health Promotion. She is dedicated to her community and active with organizations including VNA Meals on Wheels, YMSL, Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center, Family Legacy, and various activities at HPUMC.\nIn her spare time, Ashley enjoys traveling (especially summertime trips to the mountains), reading, cooking, exercising, Bible studies, and most of all, “spending time with my family.”",

  "description": "Brenda Bayless Sandoz, Executive Vice President, has been in the advertising and marketing business since her graduation from The University of Texas at Austin. She has built her career out of starting and selling businesses, mostly with a focus on some aspect of real estate. She began by starting her own ad agency, then a publishing company that produced five magazines in Texas. Sandoz now also applies her creativity and innovative thinking to the residential real estate industry.\nA long-time University Park resident in Dallas, Sandoz began her career at The Dallas Morning News in the marketing department, where her duties included producing a weekly television show, followed by working with one of the largest advertising agencies in Dallas where she became Vice President, Client Services. After 10 years, she opened her own ad agency, where the bulk of her clients were from the real estate sector.\nSandoz then launched Family Publications, Inc. publishing Dallas Family Magazine, Houston Family Magazine and several statewide publications which captured numerous awards including 'best magazine in the state of Texas,\" and \"best written,\" \"best design,\" and \"best overall\" in the national family publication category. She sold her highly successful publishing firm after only five years to a British publishing conglomerate.\nAfter researching what her next new business would be, Sandoz and her husband, Tommy, then founded TomCat Computer Services. In 2001, seeing the incredible void in the home and small business computer market, TomCat Computers Services provided computer service, installation, training, networking and repair of in-home and small business computer systems. In only four short years, TomCat grew to service over 1500 clients. The company was then sold and clients folded into the client base of a national computer products company.\n\"Everything Brenda touches turns to gold, and she has the uncanny ability to analyze and position a product to its greatest advantage,\" Allie Beth Allman, CEO of Allie Beth Allman and Associates said.\nLiving in Dallas her entire life, Sandoz has bought and sold homes for clients all over the Dallas/Fort Worth area and specializes her real estate expertise in University Park, Highland Park, Preston Hollow, North Dallas and East Dallas performing as a multimillion dollar, pinnacle producer since her first year in the business. Sandoz takes an intuitive approach to current market conditions. Trends, statistics and consumer attitudes come into play as Sandoz plans a property sale like an advertising campaign.\nSandoz also has a strong presence in her community. Her current and past commitments have included: Junior Charity League, University of Texas at Austin advisory board member, College of Communication, Texas Parents/ board member, Zeta Tau Alpha, Texas Kappa Chapter/member, Texas Exes Life Member, Sigma Alpha Epsilon/ UT Minerva Mothers Club, La Fiesta de las Banderas/committee member, Dallas Symphony/Honor Guard committee, American Heart Association/Executive Leadership Committee, University Park Leadership Council, Children's Cancer Fund/board member, Camp John Marc/Board Member, Franklin College of Switzerland/parents board member, Park Cities Professional Women/board member and Caruth Hills Neighborhood Association/board member.\nSandoz is an Executive Vice President and consistently performs at the Allie Beth Allman and Associates top performance level as a Pinnacle producer among 300 plus agents.

Her market knowledge and determination stem from a true love of real estate and helping people. By exceeding client expectations, Brittani has built her real estate career through her relationships with her clients and their referrals of family and friends. Nothing speaks more highly than gaining the loyalty and trust of those she helps.\nBeing involved in real estate from a very young age with parents and grandparents who were Realtors and builder-developers, it’s what Brittani understands and does best.  Today, as a homeowner and property investor, she knows first-hand what it takes to find, negotiate, and sell properties for her clients.   Naturally, Brittani's persistence and dedication to her clients' best interest is evident by the number of satisfied clients who count on her expertise and hard work. With strong attention to detail, communication, marketing and problem solving, you won't find anyone who is more dedicated to helping you with your home or investment property.\nWhen she's not in the office or with clients, Brittani enjoys time with her husband, sons, daughter, and Goldendoodle.  They love spending time outside, playing and watching baseball and football, taking ballet and art lessons, and traveling to the beach. You will also find Brittani volunteering at Shelton School and Bradfield Elementary School, and in Sunday School at Christ the King Church.

We were very lucky to get connected with her. Even though we had done a lot of research early on, she helped us out so much. She provided us with great detail about the Dallas market and added several additional properties for us to consider. She ultimately was able to find us a unit that wasn't even on the market yet (our purchase)! She is very knowledgeable, professional and responsive; a top-notch transaction advisor. We would definitely work with her again and will recommend her to our friends.\" - Mike Merritt\n\"I thoroughly enjoyed working with Brittani. She was attentive to my needs and did a good job at pointing me towards properties that met my criteria. Additionally, she was extremely helpful during the offer, negotiation and closing processes. I highly recommended Brittani and would definitely utilize her services for sale or purchase of my next home.\" -  Adrian Watson\n\"Brittani is amazing at her craft. Not only is she courteous and polite, but she is very professional and has a great understanding of market conditions. You definitely feel confident in her representation!\" -  Devin Gonzalez\n\"We couldn’t be happier with our experience with Brittani. We moved long distance with 3 kids and I was very nervous about finding a house that was a good fit for our family. Brittani was very responsive and supportive throughout the process and made our home search feel seamless. Thanks, Brittani!\" - The Brown Family\nI initially worked with Brittani as a buyer, and without hesitation she was my first and only call when I was ready to sell.  Brittani is an exceptional Realtor, extremely knowledgeable, great to work with and also a truly great person.  Her guidance was invaluable...from an eye for interior decorating (and literally helping lift and rearrange furniture) to ensuring every detail is in order to ensure a smooth process (on both sides of the transaction).  I highly recommend Brittani to anyone looking to buy or sell and cannot thank her enough for all her help.  - Greg Hill",

Combined with her innate capacity to listen, connect and negotiate, her Buyers and Sellers can be assured of a smooth transaction.\nCarrie is the first to admit that she enjoys industry challenges - or more specifically, overcoming them.   She says that the current market, with its low inventory and fierce competition, energizes her and pushes her to advocate for her Buyers and Sellers in exceptional and unprecedented ways. \nAs the wife of a recently retired BNSF Director, Carrie has first-hand knowledge of corporate relocations, understanding exactly what it’s like to fly into a city for a weekend and make a home selection.  Having done multiple corporate moves herself, she relates to the emotional impact that moving has on families.  She works vigorously to make the house-buying trip educational, productive and as stress-free as possible by utilizing her extensive market knowledge and arsenal of top-notch vendors.\nEverything Carrie does is purpose-driven.  Her keen eye for detail, balance and scale is a cornerstone when it comes to helping her selling-clients get the results they’re wanting - a quick, top-dollar sale.  Whether  she’s assisting Sellers with preparing their homes for the market or helping Buyers write the winning offer, Carrie has the experience, the skill sets and negotiating moxie to provide her clients with the ultimate real estate experience.   Her previous careers in furniture, lighting and building have parlayed perfectly into a career where she’s recognized as a Top Producing Realtor, marketing and selling homes in excess of six million dollars.\nWhen she isn’t working, Carrie enjoys traveling and exploring great food and red wines.  She is a voracious reader with a goal to one day publish a novel she began writing several years ago.  Carrie is a strong supporter of organizations that provide food, clothing and shelter to those in need.",

A fourth-generation Dallas native who grew up in Preston Hollow, Catherine worked in the modeling industry in Dallas, Paris and Los Angeles before returning to Dallas to raise her two children. While abroad, she absorbed the design wisdom of legendary decorators Robert Denning and Nicholas Haslam. Her aunt, the actress Jean Howard, had incredible style and took her to parties at some of the most beautiful homes in Beverly Hills. “I love Old Hollywood design and glamor,” says the house-obsessed Catherine, who has built homes in Preston Hollow, Volk Estates and Cedar Creek Lake, and whose own design projects and principles have been published in Southern Accents, PaperCity and D Home. Every experience, every project, has brought her to this moment: an adventure in real estate, finding the ideal homes for her clients’ needs — and the right buyers for her sellers. Catherine relishes connecting people to properties, whether they are first-time buyers, growing families, empty nesters or anyone looking for a weekend or holiday escape, in North Texas or anywhere. Catherine is dedicated and thorough, arming her clients with relevant information and her own expertise about the communities where she specializes, including the Park Cities, Preston Hollow, Greenway Parks, Frisco, McKinney and Prosper. Plus, she says, “being patient and knowing North Texas as well as I do gives me the knowledge to do the very best for my Clients.”\nActive in community service work — including Cattle Baron’s Ball, Junior League of Dallas, ManeGait Therapeutic Horsemanship, Incarnation House, SPCA of Texas and The Family Place — and a fervent supporter of North Texas (“the place you want to be,” she says), Catherine Phillips and her white-glove way of working are of tremendous benefit to her buyers and sellers, across North Texas or across the country.",

  "description": "Chris Pyle is a Dallas real estate veteran with over twenty years in the business and more than $750 million in sales to his credit.\nA native Texan, Chris is passionate about his work. He says he enjoys the fact that real estate is so topical and routinely comes up in discussions beyond the workplace. “It’s an important element in any community fabric – being an expert in real estate makes me better connected to my community and provides a continual incentive for me to help others.”\nChris’s methodology for success is simple: “For me, it's a full-time, seven-day-a-week process. From the time I awaken to late hours, I’m focused on all my current transactions and listings, as well as prospects.” His schedule varies daily, even on an hourly basis, depending on the client’s needs. “One of my trade secrets is that I’m a chronic list-maker, which keeps me accountable throughout the day,” he smiles. He credits a devotion to consistent availability and dependability as the keys to his professionalism. “I’m resourceful and will find solutions to any issue real estate related,” he adds\nThe Park Cities and surrounding areas, Preston Hollow, Lakewood/East Dallas, Uptown/Downtown are all areas Chris knows intimately. “Live where you work, as I like to say,” he explains. “I also enjoy working with an even mix of buyers and sellers since I have significant expertise on both sides of the transaction.”\nAs far as specific real estate “superpowers,” Chris has substantial skills as a successful negotiator, which is at the top of his list. “Due to years of marketing experience, I have a clear understanding of what it takes to bring a home to market and maximize an owner’s exposure,” he says. Understanding all areas of Dallas and its distinctive regionalism is key when it comes to guiding buyers through such an important life decision. “I also have a successful track record of handling stressful situations in a calm, productive fashion, which is a valuable service to my clients,” says Chris.\nAs a senior vice president at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Chris founded The Haven Group in 2007, which he successfully ran for many years. Then, on September 8, 2021, Chris and longtime Haven colleague Ashley Rasmussen took a bold new step when they formed The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. He says the pair had discussed building the partnership over several years. But when they finally made it official, “It just made good sense.”\n“Our new team is a partnership in which both of our names are prominent. In my two decades in real estate, it marks the first time to put my name on a brand. And I am proud to do this with Ashley.” He points to the pair’s similar styles, particularly when it comes to thoughtfully guiding buyers to the right decision. “Whether that is advertising, data analysis, or savvy marketing, in the process of the transaction or listing, our mission is to always put the client first,” Chris explains. “For Ashley and me, we’re not interested in growing beyond our bandwidth. We’re dedicated to making sure we are personally handling all our clients,” an attention to detail that is a defining hallmark of The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group.\nGeographic proximity is another important element for the team: “I live in Preston Hollow, and Ashley’s in the Park Cities, thus we cover a lot of ground in terms of direct product knowledge.”",

As a resident of University Park with a deep appreciation for architecturally complete and authentic construction, Diane brings a discerning eye and a refined understanding of what makes a home truly exceptional.\nHer philosophy is simple yet powerful: “I believe everyone who wants to own their home can do so with the right agent.” That belief drives her commitment to pairing clients with properties that align perfectly with their lifestyle and vision.\nBefore entering real estate, Diane built a distinguished career working with Fortune 100 companies and their C-level executives. Accustomed to the most demanding clients, she mastered the art of listening closely, responding quickly, and anticipating needs before they are spoken. As a business owner, she further sharpened her discipline and developed a creative problem-solving approach that now serves her real estate clients with seamless precision.\nFamily and community are central to Diane’s story. Her son played on a Texas State Championship football team, attended Texas Tech, and returned to his roots in University Park—further grounding her family in the traditions and pride of Dallas.\nAway from real estate, Diane’s passion for fitness and competition continues to inspire her. She is an avid runner who has competed in numerous races, and she enjoys daily fitness as a lifestyle. Her happiest moments are often spent at the lake or along the white-sand shores of Destin’s 30A, where she recharges with family and friends.\nAs part of Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Diane combines her luxury market knowledge, disciplined work ethic, and approachable warmth to provide an elevated experience for every client. Whether buying, selling, or investing, Diane’s clients know they have a dedicated advocate who will work tirelessly on their behalf.",

Excellence then is not an act, but a habit.\" -Aristotle\nAs an original founding partner and senior executive vice president of Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Frank Purcell has been described as playing an important role in the real estate markets he serves. Celebrating over 30 award winning years in residential real sales, Frank continues to bring energy, enthusiasm and innovation to the sales experience for both Buyers and Sellers. Frank and his wife, Jane, are Dallas natives and live in the University Park area where they raised their children.\nWhy My Clients Come Back\n“I know there are many choices for Buyers and Sellers when choosing an agent. I am always so pleased when someone hires me to represent them and I do my best to ensure that their expectations are not only met but exceeded.”\nI am ready to put my years of experience and negotiating skills to work for you! Many of Frank's sales are repeat clients and referrals. He considers it the highest compliment when a past client endorses him to their friends and family. They know that Frank will handle them personally and put his skills as a seasoned, successful agent in their best interest whether buying or selling.\nThe Secret of My Success\nThe secret to Frank's success is honesty, persistence, perseverance, loyal friends and a loving family. Real estate is always changing and there are always new challenges to overcome.  In recent years, the lack of inventory at attractive prices has been a big challenge and Frank has been successful in ferreting out new listings and off- market properties by actively networking with other agents and making sure he knows all of the properties available. In 2024 Allie Beth Allman & Associates participated in $1 Billion of off- market or hip pocket sales that were not in MLS.\nMemberships, Affiliations, Awards:\nPark Cities Presbyterian Church\nThe Masters of Residential Real Estate Networking Group\n(25 of the Top Real Estate Professionals in the Metroplex )\nWho's Who in Dallas Real Estate, D Homes\n“Gatekeeper to Dallas' Platinum Real Estate”, Town and Country Magazine (Only agent recognized for Dallas' Luxury Market)\nD Best Realtor, D Magazine, Recognized Every Year 1998-Present\nD Hall of Fame Best Realtor, D Magazine Award",

  "description": "If I had to choose one word to describe myself, it would be “blessed.” Time and again, chance encounters and experiences have changed the course of my life for the better. Situations that initially seemed like the worst possible outcomes almost always turned out to be far from it.\nA few years ago, a birthday lunch and a long conversation with a very close friend led to my current role in real estate. I didn’t go to lunch that day with a new adventure in mind, but I left with a renewed sense of purpose and excitement, deciding to build on my long career in sales—this time in the world of actual “bricks-and-mortar” instead of fashion.\nAs a young woman, sheer luck brought me to an entry-level job in retail, where my inquisitive and determined spirit helped me advance through the ranks at Dallas’ beloved Neiman Marcus. I managed several full-line stores, led the start-up of NeimanMarcus.com, and eventually ran the 28-store Last Call division. Inspired by many mentors over the years, I developed a true entrepreneurial spirit within a very large and successful company.\nMy time in real estate has allowed me to build on that foundation and continue doing what I really love: connecting with people. Building a network, paying attention to detail, and finding positive outcomes for clients keeps me going every day.\nI have served on the boards of numerous non-profit and professional organizations, as well as on the Board of my HOA. I've also been involved in many charitable fundraising projects and have been a featured speaker at several retail symposiums and university lecture series. I am a proud 7th-generation Texan.\nWhile at Neiman Marcus, I met my wonderful husband Roger when he called on me to sell advertising. He got the sale, and I got him.",

  "description": "I believe a realtor provides guidance, expertise and calm during what is often the most important purchase in your life. You really want someone who feels like a friend, a protector, marketer, negotiator and collaborator. After spending twenty plus years as a broadcast anchor/reporter and owning my own interior design firm, I am proud to have earned my real estate license. I am a new agent who brings enthusiasm to the market along with my well-honed skills as a communicator, storyteller, renovator and designer. I’m especially humbled to work with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and with Susan Baldwin of the Baldwin Group, a longtime top producing team. I bring to the team a fierce loyalty to our clients; the willingness to work hard; and the energy to find solutions when met with unique obstacles. \n\nAs a longtime real estate investor in Dallas, I have extensive knowledge of the Dallas market having lived in Lake Highlands, Highland Park, Bluffview and University Park. Given my zip code history, I feel very connected to how emotional and exciting the search for the perfect home and neighborhood can be; I also know first hand the challenges of getting a home ready for sale. However, my family has always had an ally to help us conquer any real estate obstacle: a good realtor.\n\nClearly, my family and I are not afraid of the moving process, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t experienced the stress and strain that can go along with buying and selling a home. One noted move was during the sweltering month of August while I was nine months pregnant and had a toddler and three dogs in tow. It seemed impossible, but with the help of our realtor, we made it work. We were also met with unique challenges while holding three properties during the housing market crash in 2008. Through good advice and faith that the market would rebound, we were able to profit through leasing and holding onto our investments. Historically, real estate has always brought my family financial security and assurance. I never tire of searching for the perfect home and making a space our own.\n\nIn addition to my love of house hunting and negotiating, I also thrive on deadlines and have a proven track record of finding calm and clarity during chaos. I love meeting new people and discovering their stories. Plus, I firmly believe that buying or selling a home can be a wonderful experience and an absolute joy. I would be honored to help you create your favorite story in your next home.\n\nHeather Behrens is a Texan by choice and a native of Oklahoma where she attended the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma and received a bachelor of arts degree in communication. She moved to Dallas in 1996 and has worked in the news rooms of KRLD/CBS, KEWS, TXCN, USA Radio Network, KDAF and KTVT.

An interest in corporate negotiations and lending led him to the private mortgage insurance industry where he traveled extensively across the country opening local offices and negotiating commercial leases. His extensive background in the often spirited world of commercial lending and contract negotiation coupled with his breadth of experience working closely with high net worth donors in international settings from South Africa to Dubai provided the springboard for his career in residential real estate.\nMost recently, John served as Executive Director of the Dallas-based Wilson Foundation, the private family foundation of the interior and architectural design firm Wilson Associates, founded by Park Cities native Tricia Wilson. Charged with developing the foundation’s financial capacity to support its educational and health initiatives in the developing world, John’s work frequently intersected with the elite clientele to which Wilson Associates catered. He witnessed first-hand the beauty of creating well-appointed spaces for luxury hotels, casinos and private residences.\nToday, his application of the detail-oriented nature of those huge deals to residential transactions provides a superior level of service to his real estate clients. A master negotiator and networker, John took every opportunity to meet with lead designers, architects and key decision-makers to familiarize himself with the projects and project leaders who made each design project possible, helping him develop a keen appreciation for luxury finishes and high-end interior design in international settings.\nDuring his tenure with Wilson, John increased the foundation’s corpus by 120 percent. His extensive experience working with high net worth individuals in a variety of cultural settings prepared him for the delicate and commanding world of luxury residential real estate.\nJohn brings his deep roots in the Dallas area and particularly the Park Cities to the Haven Group and the Allie Beth Allman & Associates team. As a resident of the Park Cities, he has a deep appreciation for the charming neighborhoods, beautiful architecture and high-quality educational opportunities that draw people to the area. He moved to Allie Beth Allman to provide an even higher level of service to his ever-growing luxury client base.\nWith a passion for helping and serving others, John strives to provide a reassuring presence to his clients during every aspect of the transaction.

She is highly-organized and knows how to satisfy a demanding, discerning client. No surprises. Detailed research. Anticipation of needs. Complete preparation. Brilliant negotiating. The competitive edge. Tenacious with a warm, personable side.\nShe honed her skills in the business world with a career foundation in executive assistant roles, marketing a luxury jet aircraft, working in the corridors of power at the top of the Dallas business community.\nToday, she draws on the same bounty of talent, skills and depth of knowledge to deliver unparalleled service to clients.\nA Dallas native, Karen grew up in Lakewood, the daughter of a dentist and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. She raised her own family in Dallas. She knows the sense of home, community and the unique characteristics of Dallas residential neighborhoods -- selling today in Park Cities, Preston Hollow, Lakewood and throughout the DFW Metroplex.\nShe evolved her real estate expertise as Dallas itself grew and developed -- acquiring unique niches of specialization and portfolio of cumulative market knowledge that makes her an invaluable advisor to new as well as longtime clients and their families.\nIn addition to traditional single family residential, Karen has diverse areas of experience and expertise that includes condominiums, high-rises, townhomes, investment properties, ranches and even international properties.\nOn the developer side, she created full marketing plans and led on-site sales for Wellington on the Creek, a single family home development in Bluffview and Portobello by the Creek, luxury townhomes in West Village, selling each of these master planned communities ahead of projections. That experience gave her a better understanding of construction, design and staging that has helped her guide her clients every day since.\nKaren is well-networked and well-respected within the real estate, legal and financing community, an invaluable asset for buyers and sellers who benefit from her insider knowledge, longtime relationships and instant rapport with industry colleagues who come into play in each unique transaction.\nFrom expertly staging each photograph to perfection for a new listing to preparing winning contracts for her buyers, Karen throws the full force of her energy and creativity into developing a vision for each client. That is a big part of Karen's formula for success in the fast-moving Dallas real estate market. This multimillion-dollar producer works hard and doesn't stop.\nWhen she is not guiding real estate transactions, she is giving back to the city she loves through her participation as a member of the Board of Nexus Recovery Center for Women and as founder of their highly successful fundraising gala, A Night for Nexus. She is also the founding member of one of Dallas most successful Business Networking International groups situated in The Tower Club.

This was our first home purchase and we were moving from out of state so there were many additional details and complications, but Laura was on top of everything and incredibly helpful in answering our many questions. We would highly recommend working with Laura.”\n“My husband and I relocated to Dallas recently for work and were referred to Laura through my employer. We tried to prepare ourselves for home buying by reading books and following listings online, but Laura’s step-by-step guidance through the fast-paced days of negotiations, inspections, and contract amendments was critically important. From contract to closing, Laura was incredibly proactive toward resolving uncertainties and ambiguities with commitments in writing so that our actual closing had no drama whatsoever. We wholeheartedly recommend Laura.”",

  "description": "Leslie Moore takes a human-centered approach to real estate, understanding that no two clients (like no two properties) are exactly alike.\nFrom her years working in the corporate world as an HR professional, Leslie harnesses her aptitude for communication, organization, and emotional intelligence to work with clients with diverse backgrounds, needs, and tastes. Combined with a sharp eye for design, a love for the community where she lives and works, and insight into the competitive Dallas-Fort Worth market, Leslie makes an ideal partner for anyone buying or selling a home.\nPart of the dynamic Ecklund-Luker Group, a high-producing team with Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Leslie offers a unique perspective on the local market. She grew up in the area and has seen sleepy hamlets like Southlake, Colleyville and Keller blossom into dynamic and desirable communities. Although she moved to the city to start her career, Leslie has since moved back to raise her family, and she knows she’s not alone. Leslie loves “selling where she lives”. As a longtime resident of the area, she has successfully helped new wave of families seeking suburban life, attracted by the exemplary schools, safety, comfort, and convenience that the area offers.\nLeslie is intimately aware of what clients are looking for in a home. Her keen design sense helps transform drab, outdated spaces into welcoming, livable nests that appeal to modern families. And, in a region where inventory is scarce, she sees past cosmetic issues to help clients envision the possibilities for turning an ordinary house into a stunning showpiece.\n“I partner with my clients to identify current needs along with those that may arise in the future. Whether they are executives looking to downsize or families searching for their dream homes, I believe it’s important to work with an agent who truly knows the area and can see the potential and beauty in any property,” adds Leslie.\nWhen she’s not super-serving her clients, Leslie enjoys spending time her husband, two children, and two dogs. She is also a passionate volunteer, fundraiser, community leader, and church member. If she can find the time, Leslie loves to travel, and counts her proximity to DFW airport as one of the great perks of living in the area.\nTop Producer- 2019-2022\nBest D Top Producers and Best Real Estate Agents- 2019-2022\n360 West Best Real Estate Agent & Top Producer 2018-2022\nAllie Beth Allman Top Producing Team 2019-2022",

She knows the market, she knows how to position your house to sell, and she understands all aspects of the process. She sold my house in 5 days for the price I was hoping for. Highly recommend Maureen.\"\n\n\"Maureen sold three family homes for me in just a few months. From start to finish, she handled every aspect of the sales, from starting comps to closing with efficiency and professionalism. She is a wonderful advocate for and protector of her clients' interests. A very good marketer, she is energetic and proactive in creating the best-case scenario for a prompt sale. Maureen is a solid businesswoman who also is friendly and engaging, great to work with. She made selling our homes a great experience, and we had fun doing so. I highly recommend her services.”\n\n\"Maureen's market knowledge helped us immensely in the sale of our home. We had been approached by a builder with an offer and weren't sure if it was market price. We hired Maureen and she worked to get us a much better price in a very short amount of time. Maureen has high integrity, is a pleasure to work with, and puts her clients' interest first. I would highly recommend you work with Maureen on your next real estate transaction!”\n\n\"Maureen Frieze has represented us this year as both buyers and sellers. We did the 'buy' first. Maureen was patient and hard-working. She was never tired of sharing listings, or taking us to see the ones we were interested in. She never pressured us. She always acknowledged: 'It's a process'. We're happy with our purchase. Then she tackled selling our house in Lobello Estates. Again, Maureen proved to be a very hard worker. She helped us get out of the house we were selling, and recommended movers and subcontractors to help with necessary repairs. Then she went to work to get the best possible price for the house we sold. If you want a motivated, hard-working realtor who really knows Preston Hollow, please consider Maureen Frieze. If you want to look or sell elsewhere, she'll bring the formidable resources of Allie Beth Allman to work for you.\"\n\n\"Thanks so much for getting our sale closed. You did a great job, from researching and giving us information regarding pricing and how the pricing changed to staying on top of the “to do” items. You were pretty much solely responsible for bringing closure to the “fence” issue by immediately communicating with the builder next door who had removed our fence creating a potential code violation issue. You have a wonderful style and manner- negotiating hard for your client but also having a practical common-sense approach to thorny issues. Thanks again, we could not have sold it without you!\"",

  "description": "Mike Bates is a real estate agent at Allie Beth Allman & Associates in Dallas.\nHe’s what some might refer to as a classic “renaissance man,” an archetypal entrepreneur with a long string of business successes. And when it comes to real estate agents, that can a very good person to know. To understand Mike’s present, it’s important to recognize his past. He is from Abilene, a Texan by birth with a distinctive professional background.\n“I’ve been called a ‘turn around guy’ by clients and the ‘guy who gets it done,’” he explains. “Usually while others are staring at their phones,” he adds with a laugh. It is that kind of determination that’s made Mike an indispensable resource for his clients. Educated in Texas, Mike graduated the University of North Texas with a double major in General Business and Hospitality Management.\n“I began working in my family’s small manufacturing business as a machine operator before I could even drive.” Together he and his dad would join forces to build Mike’s very first car, which, as it turned out, was the beginning of a lifelong fascination. “Over the years, I have owned more than 300 cars,” he says. “I have five or 10 at any given time that I’m working on. In fact, I paid for my education working in hospitality and selling the cars that I rebuilt.”\nWhile attending college, he also started buying and selling condos in Dallas’s Uptown district where he did basic work while living in the renovation projects. Mike’s life took a turn in 2004 when a realtor failed to show for a routine closing. As a result, he got his own license and promptly generated $4 million in sales through his first 9 months in the business. With his family, Mike purchased an assisted living facility, Serenity Estates located west of Fort Worth in Mineral Wells. It was renovated, opened in 2014, and still operates to this day.\nThe diverse qualities of Mike’s career provide for numerous strengths as a real estate agent. His experience as a general contractor, a deep understanding of the mechanics of homes, and direct access to skilled repair and craftspeople, plus an eye for detail, and knowledge about senior living issues provide tangible advantages to clients. He wakes up every morning determined to serve, which, he says, often means assisting with maintenance challenges and property issues that arise long after the sale. “I strive to take the stress out of owning property by consulting wisely on what best fits my clients and makes the most of their return on investments.\"\nHe joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates Real Estate in November of 2021 because he wanted to be a part of a quality team, one that enjoys the admiration of clients as well as competitors, recognized as the area’s premier brokerage.\nMike has lived in Oak Cliff with his husband, Ryan, of 23 years since 2005, “way before it was cool,” he chuckles. However, he works everywhere in Dallas-Fort Worth (as well as in Parker and Palo Pinto Counties), proud of the brand he’s carefully cultivated over the years, focused on experience, unique insights, and a sincere dedication to top-notch service. “When you call me, you get me … not an assistant,” he explains.\nOver the years Mike has consistently been recognized for his work, honored time and again by D Best, Advocate Best, and others, as well as a top producer at competing firms prior to joining Allie Beth Allman & Associates. A concerned community advocate, he volunteers his time to organizations including North Texas Scottie Rescue, serving on their Board of Directors since 2016.",

  "description": "With over 10 years of experience in the real estate industry, Page has built her business on personal referrals from satisfied customers. Being responsive to her clients' needs has led Page to work the entire Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with areas of focus on Preston Hollow, Bluffview, Highland Park, East Dallas , Kessler Park, North Dallas, Plano, Frisco, Parker and surrounding areas.\n\"Listening is the most essential role of a Realtor in order to present each client with the best options available in their desired price point,\" said Page Fielder, Senior Vice President of Allie Beth Allman and Associates. \"My greatest reward of my job is getting to know and serve my clients on a level where many of them are now lifelong friends.\"\nPage is an invaluable resource for clients who are new to the area; after raising five children that attended different private schools, she has vast and in-depth knowledge about private schools and their neighborhoods. As a founding member of the Kessler School, Page worked with a group of neighbors to see that the children in the area had a strong private school option. She organized some of the very first \"Where Affair\" dinners to bring neighbors together to support the school. The school has been very successful and, in turn, helped boost property values in the area.\nPage earned a business degree from North Texas University and has a career background in the insurance industry. Working for a major corporation instilled in her a love for detail and negotiation. After having children, she continued her passion by helping her friends negotiate salaries, which has evolved into negotiating home purchases in the real estate world. Her talents are proven by her record as a top-performing agent, leading to her promotion to the role of Senior Vice President with Allie Beth Allman.",

  "description": "Raul Ruiz is a dedicated real estate professional at Allie Beth Allman & Associates in Dallas. He specializes in a number of important areas including market knowledge and analysis, high-touch client service, and a depth of expertise in renovation, construction, and project management.\nHe joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates in January 2021, moving from a Dallas boutique brokerage, Clay Stapp + Company, where he worked for over four year as a real estate agent. During his time with Stapp, Raul earned a solid reputation as a hands-on, customer-focused expert, with a distinguished record. In 2016 he was named the company’s Rookie of the Year. Raul ranked among the firm’s top three producers twice and was Stapp’s number one producer in 2020.\nMaking the move to Allie Beth Allman & Associates was “logical,” he says, pointing to the company’s well-established strength in local zip codes where he’s experienced solid business growth. Raul describes himself as “data-driven,” someone who spends a significant volume of time gathering statistics on each neighborhood to clearly understand agents, builders, and the market.\nDuring his career, he has also been an exclusive investor in new luxury homes in some of the hottest neighborhoods in Dallas. Raul also owns and manages a portfolio of properties, which he believes has contributed to his concentration of knowledge on everything from business processes to the development of a circle of trusted local-subcontractors, and other essential services needed when buying or selling a home.\nHaving spent years living in Dallas, the Mexico City native knows the entire region well. Raul first came to Texas in 2005 to attend Southern Methodist University. He graduated with majors in Advertising as well as Markets & Culture. Raul’s college experience in the heart of the Park Cities helped him establish close personal and professional connections in the local market where he’s worked since finishing college.\nAlways an avid learner, Raul takes pride in constantly honing his business skills. He closely follows consumer trends and buying-habits, all designed to assist his clients, and is fluent in English and Spanish, a bonus for international clients.\nGoing the extra mile is an important trademark, something he brings to his clients, who have described his work as “beyond the call of duty,” “first-class all the way,” and “an incredible asset”. Raul’s “critical eye,” as described by a recent buyer, and an intimate understanding of the building process, materials, and the costs involved, he believes is rare and an invaluable asset for his clients. But Raul’s greatest skill is his client-oriented service, carefully covering every base for buyers and sellers. “My client’s financial health is a priority,” he explains. In fact, his overarching business mantra is completely centered on the client, their needs, and what’s best for them.\nAs for the foundation of his success, Raul credits his parents who told him to make sure he’s always loyal, diligent, respectful, grateful, and above all, to “never stop learning.”",

  "description": "The best realtors are the ones who start by listening—listening to understand their clients' preferences, constraints and goals. They then use their experience and understanding of the current real estate market to help the clients achieve their goals. The best realtors also know that even the smoothest real estate transactions can be stressful and help prepare their clients to face any challenges with informed confidence.\nI honed my listening skills (and learned the perils of communication failures) as a flight attendant recruiter, instructor and supervisor at American Airlines. After the birth of my sons, I became a special education teacher with HPISD, where I learned to help people through uniquely challenging situations every day. More recently, I used my listening skills as the Women's Council of Realtor's Dallas Network as their 2017 President by actively listening to the needs of Realtor and Affiliate members and creating educational programs to meet those needs.\nI look forward to putting these experiences and skills—and my knowledge of the Dallas real estate market—to work for you to help you reach your real estate goals.",

  "description": "The customer care and commitment begins with hello, and it never ends. That’s the level of service and dedication that Sada Millican has provided North Texas home buyers and sellers for over 25 years.\n“I become very attached to the people that I have the opportunity of bringing together with the right home,” says Sada, who has lived and been involved in the Dallas community for over 40 years. “Years ago I drove past a darling Tudor home in the M Streets that I sold a young couple, and sitting in front was an empty baby stroller box. I just had to stop and get the family news.” The past customers were delighted to inform Sada that their first child was due the following week. Two more children later, Sada has since sold that home and helped them in the purchase of another home for their growing family.\nThere are so many stories like that that are the true testament to the high quality of service, expertise and long-term commitment that Sada offers. Generations of relocating families and individuals have trusted her with the purchase or sale of their most important investment, their home.\nBeyond the personal touch, Sada Millican brings to her customers a broad knowledge of numerous communities in the Metroplex. Formerly a legal assistant to a real estate attorney, she melds her marketing and sales skills with a meticulous attention to deliver the best results in the shortest time possible.\n“Knowing so many neighborhoods, I am able to help my home buyers quickly zero in on the areas that best fit their budget and needs,” explains Sada. “This also helps me to target market the listings I represent to the most likely candidates for a property and its lifestyle.”\nAn active volunteer in the community, Sada Millican and her husband of over 40 years raised their grown sons in the Dallas area. Her roots are equally deep in the real estate community where she has established a network with her colleagues and a strong reputation for integrity and drive.\n “I am dedicated to being an efficient, effective and professional businesswoman,” says Sada Millican. “Allie Beth Allman & Associates is a firm that stands above all of the others in providing an environment that empowers excellence in all that we do for our customers.”",

  "description": "With a career that bridges high-level real estate leadership and deep architectural knowledge, Scott Gill brings an insightful and valuable perspective to every client interaction. As a top-producing agent, managing broker, and former brokerage owner, Scott leverages decades of experience to guide buyers and sellers with confidence, clarity, and insight. His clients benefit not only from his market expertise but also from his finely tuned eye for design and construction—a rare combination that truly sets him apart.\nScott’s meticulous attention to detail helps clients make informed, confident decisions. He’s quick to spot opportunities others might miss and is adept at navigating the complexities of offers, negotiations, and contracts.  Scott’s background in architecture and design gives his clients a distinct advantage, whether reviewing construction documents, evaluating floor plans, or assessing a property's long-term potential.  \nDescribed by clients as prompt, positive, thorough, and collaborative, Scott is known for building easy, cordial relationships with everyone involved in a transaction—buyers, sellers, Realtors, vendors, and contractors alike. These strong industry relationships often put him at the front of the line for off-market and early-access opportunities, a major benefit in DFW’s fast-paced market.\nScott’s insatiable curiosity and analytical mind make him a natural at identifying a property's hidden potential—or its limitations.  He combines patience and experience to act as a trusted advisor throughout the buying or selling journey. His intuitive understanding of how architectural details can shape everyday life allows him to guide clients toward homes that not only function beautifully but also bring lasting joy and long-term value.\nScott began his career in real estate as a principal in a family-run commercial property enterprise before turning to residential brokerage. After earning “Rookie of the Year” his first year in the business, Scott continued to grow a client-centered practice built on referrals and repeat business. Today, the majority of Stegeman/Gill clients come through word of mouth—from family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues of satisfied clients.\nHis years as a managing broker of premier real estate offices in Chicago, Winnetka, and Evanston make him a natural when forming relationships with other Realtors.  His service on condominium and co-op boards gives him a strong foundation in real estate operations, governance, and property investment.  His ability to interpret floorplans at a glance, assess a home's design potential, and anticipate how architectural elements will impact both lifestyle and resale value make him a trusted partner throughout the transaction and beyond. He approaches each client experience with sensitivity, adaptability, and pace, tailoring his strategy to align with their needs and aspirations.\nScott holds a PhD in Architectural History from the University of Texas at Austin, an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Master of Architecture from Rice University, and a Bachelor of Arts in History from Stanford University.  He is a director of the Texas Chapter of the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art and a current member and past director of the Society of Architectural Historians.\nFor clients who share his love of design, Scott is also the author of several award-winning books on American architecture, including Kentucky Houses of Stratton Hammon, Country Houses of Louisville, 1899–1939, and Gideon Shryock: His Life and Architecture, 1802–1880 — all available from independent booksellers or Amazon.",

  "description": "Driven by a passion for helping people buy and sell homes, Sunny Wood combines unparalleled local expertise with exceptional client service to produce extraordinary results. After moving to Dallas from the East Coast with her husband, Sunny Wood quickly established herself as one of the foremost real estate agents in the region, consistently recognized as a top producer in D Magazine, Neighborhood Advocate, and Texas Monthly. By leveraging her experience, persistence, and can-do positive attitude against some of the toughest economic cycles in Texas history, Sunny continues to raise the bar.\nAsking the right questions and listening to clients' wants and needs have helped Sunny accomplish several benchmarks in her storied career. In the late 90's she was tasked to assist with one of Dallas' first Intown Housing initiatives - the acquisition and development of four historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which were transformed into 200 residential lofts. \"These old factories were vacant and in disrepair. The city of Dallas offered funds to developers to save these buildings from the wrecking ball and turn them into living spaces. Now, the downtown area boasts several thousand residential units and a world class Arts District, and the streets are bustling with activity. I am proud to be part of that transition,\" says Sunny.\nA 40-year resident of Dallas, Sunny also enjoys focusing her sales and marketing efforts on the neighborhoods where she and her husband have put down their own roots. Together they raised their two daughters in Lakewood and Lake Highlands, and were actively involved in Booker T Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts,\nNow living near the Park Cities, Sunny has expanded her business to include University Park, Highland Park, Preston Hollow, Devonshire, Greenway Parks, Uptown/Downtown Dallas, Richardson, Plano, Farmer’s Branch, Coppell, Frisco, Southlake, and beyond. Her experience in buying and selling homes spans from every corner of Dallas and deep into Texas Hill Country. \nSunny is a graduate of the University of Maryland and a member of the Greater Dallas, Texas and National Association of Realtors. She frequently participates in professional development programs to stay current in the marketplace and has earned her Accredited Luxury Home Specialist Designation as well as her Accredited Buyer’s Representative designations. Sunny has established a loyal following of repeat clients and referrals which keep her focused on what matters most-relationships. \n\"Sunny was the best agent I have ever worked with and my husband and I have bought many homes over the last 25 years,\" said Nancy, a repeat client. \"Her sense of loyalty to us was impeccable,\" explained clients Daniel and Sammy. \"Not only did she help us look at properties, she was at our beck and call until our home was found, and she was there until all inspections were passed, offers were agreed upon, and happiness/ownership was signed sealed and delivered. She will always be the first person we suggest to our friends and family.\"\nFrom real estate sales and leasing, to high-end developments and property management in virtually every Dallas community, Sunny has the knowledge and business savvy to get the job done. If you are in the market for an accomplished professional to sell your property in record time at the highest possible price, or, looking for an expert to guide you to the perfect Dallas neighborhood, give Sunny a call.",

  "description": "For Susan, working with every customer is like a new adventure. For nearly three decades, Bratton has enjoyed the adventures she embarks upon with her clients, energetically helping them find the perfect home and neighborhood.\nBratton, a Senior Vice President and Broker Associate with Allie Beth Allman & Associates, has lived and worked in and around the Park Cities, Preston Hollow, Turtle Creek, Oak Lawn, Uptown, and downtown Dallas areas since 1989. She entered real estate by way of fashion. A former clothing designer, she sold her line quickly which piqued her interest in sales. I thought if I could sell shirts and pants, I could sell something even bigger…better, she says. Today, Bratton is known within the industry for developing a new area in Turtle Creek where she sold out numerous developments in record time, listing and selling many of them herself.\nA self-developed marketing plan combined with a passion for all things home, garden, and design have contributed to her success. I enjoy remodeling and staging my listings. Adding that extra touch to my real estate acumen has shortened time on market to just hours, has increased profits, and has garnered well over listing price and multiple offers.\nClients often cite Bratton's interest in their wants and needs and ability to truly listen to them as one of the many reasons they hire and refer to her. It is so gratifying to help them find a home they fall in love with and one that is a great investment, she says. When Bratton isn't busy helping buyers and sellers, she travels the world and feels that broadens her knowledge of design. She has also devoted time and attention to the communities and charities she loves holding significant positions in many.\nDESIGNATIONS, AFFILIATIONS & AWARDS:\nSenior Vice President; Broker Associate; Historic Home Specialist;\nCharities: Cattle Baron's Ball, The National Kidney Foundation, Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas AT&T Performing Arts Center, Winspear Opera House, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Dallas Theater Center, Nasher Sculpture Center, Star Chefs, The Family Place, Camp Esperanza",

  "description": "There's just something about her! To get the inside scoop on real estate legend Terri Cox, it would take a reporter all day and night. Fortunately, her clients and colleagues were able to share plenty of insights on this one-of-a-kind professional.\nReaching the pinnacle of success as the No. 2 individual producer in 2016 at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, the market leader in luxury real estate, illustrates perfectly the can-do winning attitude that radiates from Cox. Here's how others describe her: contagious, committed, courageous, and client-centered with clear business acumen. She really knows real estate. She cares, and it shows.\nCox began her career in commercial real estate and property management in 1985, moving to residential sales at Ellen Terry, REALTORS in 1995. In her first year, Cox sold millions of dollars in real estate and was awarded the Rookie of the Year Spirit Award. She was also Ellen Terry's first recipient of the highly regarded Service with a Heart Award. In 2007, she joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates where she is an executive vice president, a position earned through leadership and achieving consistent high sales volume. Her career continues to soar.\nWhat is it about her? Charisma? A sixth sense? It's much more than that. Cox is an authentic individual who is in a unique place to empathize with her clients' real life experiences. Widowed at a young age and the now-single parent of a dynamic 16-year-old, courage and commitment stand out among the best of her character qualities. She meets life and business head on with courageous perseverance, maintaining a fully orchestrated, high-performance schedule–up at 5 a.m. (no kidding), committed all day long to helping her clients achieve their real estate dreams.\nWhether you're going modern in Preston Hollow, living the unhurried Lakewood lifestyle, or gaining space for a growing family in the Park Cities, Terri Patrick Cox is the consummate real estate pro. After hearing Cox's story, it's not surprising that she is one of this year's top producers (D Magazine July 2011 Issue).\nSpecialization:\nPark Cities, Preston Hollow, Lakewood\nDesignations, Affiliations & Awards:\nSenior Vice President, Allie Beth Allman & Associates; No. 2 Individual Producer 2014, Allie Beth Allman & Associates; D Magazine Top Producer, Accredited Buyer Representative; Historic Home Specialist; Women's Auxiliary to Children's Medical Center (Lifetime Member); The Partnership (Founding Member); Chi Omega Alumn",

  "description": "TOM AMIS Architecturally Inspired Service and Expertise with a Global Reach\nWith a 40-year track record of results as an accomplished Dallas architect, Tom Amis lives and breathes homes. He discovered early his talent for reading plans coupled with an innate ability to understand a space and its design. Today he uses those same skills to help people artfully buy and sell homes across the Metroplex.\n“Tom is one of the most diligent, problem-solving architects I’ve worked with in my career,” says one client. “I’ve always respected the fact that we could communicate in a forthright, honest manner to develop solutions that provided the most benefit for the project. Budget control, design integrity, technical competence, attention to detail, and an uncompromising pursuit of excellence are among the attributes Tom brings to the table. Quite simply, what I respect most about Tom Amis are his personal and professional integrity and genuine care for providing exemplary service with a positive, whatever-it-takes attitude.”\nThe native Texan’s keen eye for design and lifelong familiarity with the city, make him the perfect complement to wife Buff’s thriving real estate career. Together, the pair deliver first-class service and architectural expertise, coupled by custom tailored marketing plans and a passion for homes that is unrivaled. “We are uniquely skilled and passionately committed to delivering superior personalized service. Our clients value our hands-on approach, and we pride ourselves on keeping every client’s best interests at heart,” says Tom.\nSkillful execution in all aspects of design, construction, development, and project management, earned Tom the honor of The Millennium Award of Excellence by the Wynne/Jackson Group – an elite real estate development firm with over $1 billion in successful residential and commercial engagements. This, combined with his sensitivity to each clients’ wants and needs regardless of price point, make him an invaluable asset.\nTom is a graduate of the University of Texas in Austin where he achieved a Masters degree in Architecture with an emphasis on historic preservation. He received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University, and is an alumnus of the St. Marks School of Dallas. He lives happily in Midway Hollow with his wife of 38+ years, and is the proud father of two grown daughters. Tom is an active member of the Highland Park Presbyterian Church where he participates in feeding the homeless and recovery programs, like Body and Soul Homeless Feeding and Reconciliation Outreach. Tom also enjoys volunteering at Habitat for Humanity, TransForm Dallas, and has a passion for mission trips to Cuba.\nRecognized for his high level of integrity and strong attention to detail, Tom brings proven architectural expertise and an unparalleled client commitment to every facet of a real estate transaction. If you seek architecturally inspired service with a global reach, give Tom Amis a call.\n“I just wanted to let you know how pleased we were with Buff and Tom Amis, who recently helped us sell our house in Caruth Court.  Their insight into the market was invaluable, which allowed us to price the property precisely, (and profitably) and get it sold in two days!  I think that Buff’s experience in interior design enables potential buyers to see clearly the possibilities of a new home, as does Tom’s training as an architect.  Beyond that, Buff and Tom were helpful, friendly, not pushy, and exactly what we wanted and needed to get us through this transaction.  I would recommend them without reservation to anyone who is thinking about buying or selling a home in the Dallas area.  Over the years we have bought and sold a number of homes and have used Buff for our last two transactions.”  Victor G. Bloede, Jr. \n“Buff and Tom Amis made the purchase of our home actually fun and exciting! They helped us every step of the way - giving us referrals for many of the items we wanted to change or needed to address. We also did a renovation and used a suggestion that Tom had made during a walk through. His expertise and experience as architect were perfect. Even after our closing, they continued to help - their follow-through was beyond expectation. They got us in our perfect home and we highly recommend them.”  William and Sandra Fegan \n“When I listen to my friends and colleagues discuss their unfortunate real estate deals, I almost feel guilty! You handled both of our recent transactions beautifully. Thank you for your attention to detail, willingness to answer our unending questions with patience, and superb negotiating skills. From our initial meeting to discuss listing our home, we knew that we had made the right decision in choosing you to represent us. Your suggestions and advice throughout the sale of our home were right on target. When we described our \"dream home\", you far exceeded our expectations in locating the ideal new home for us. You have the gift of being assertive when necessary, yet remaining pleasant and kind at all times. We appreciate your high ethical standards and excellent communication skills. Thank you for removing the stress that typically accompanies the sale and purchase of a new home.”  Greg Farnsworth",

Matching people with the best home and location for them is a passion for me and I look forward to it every day. Primarily specializing in University Park, Highland Park, Southlake, Westlake, North Dallas, Preston Hollow, Devonshire, Bluffview, Lakewood, Uptown, the gorgeous Dallas High Rises and the newer developments in the areas of Plano, Frisco, McKinney & Parker all depending on what my clients need and prefer. These areas represent some of the most recognized neighborhoods, school districts and suburbs in the metroplex and present a diverse array of life styles and opportunities in order to meet your real estate goals be it schools, price point, style, location, or investment strategy. Working with buyers, sellers, investors and relocation and speaking both English and Spanish allows me to often represent people through generations even as their children find a need for college housing, a new home after graduation, homes for employees as they transfer to Dallas and as they downsize and upsize in life. A home is everything. Life happens in a home. It's where hopes and dreams are born. My strong team of several agents and coordinators has a keen ability to coordinate all of the details of today’s sophisticated buying transactions from finding that perfect home, negotiating the transaction, arranging the financing, inspecting the property and successfully closing to selling including the staging, pricing and marketing in order to get the best price in the least amount of time.  Strong, personal relationships with other REALTORS, Luxury Portfolio International and the excellent knowledge of the Metroplex expands available real estate offerings through powerful local and global resources to give you the best options and choices.\nBackground: I have been representing buyers and sellers of real estate since college days while I earned a BS in Environmental Biology and Chemistry. As it turns out, real estate has always been my passion. I do have three accomplished daughters: the oldest is an attorney practicing locally,  another is a pharmacist  and the youngest is a marketing executive with an international firm.  Speaking Spanish has allowed us to live in several other countries as my children grew up and helps me when representing clients from Mexico, South America and Europe.
